Whizz together the 2 peeled garlic cloves, parsley and 1 tsp olive oil in a food processor. Add the breadcrumbs and seasoning before pulsing briefly to mix. Tip onto a plate.\nCut a slit (roughly thumb-length) in the side of each chicken breast, at the plump end. Spoon a quarter of the soft cheese into each hole and press the edges together to seal. Rub 2 tsp oil over all the chicken breasts before pressing the herby crumbs onto them.\nPlace the coated chicken in a shallow roasting tin. Scatter round the remaining unpeeled garlic cloves and drizzle with the rest of the oil. Bake for 20-25 mins until the chicken is cooked and crumbs crisp and golden. Squeeze out the soft, roasted garlic from the skins and serve with the chicken.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-256465_11-3b0bda1.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "327 calories", "fatContent": "12 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "1 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "38 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.8 milligram of sodium"}}
