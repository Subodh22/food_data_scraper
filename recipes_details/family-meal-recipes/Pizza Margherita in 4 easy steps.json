{"title": "Pizza Margherita in 4 easy steps", "time": 35, "yields": "2 item(s)", "ingredients": ["300g strong bread flour", "1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)", "1 tsp salt", "1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling", "100ml passata", "handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried", "1 garlic clove, crushed", "125g ball mozzarella, sliced", "handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)", "handful of cherry tomatoes, halved", "handful of basil leaves (optional)"], "instructions": "Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it\u2019s not essential for a thin crust.\nMake the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.\nRoll out the dough: if you\u2019ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.\nTop and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-51643_11-2f4a2cc.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "431 calories", "fatContent": "15 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "2 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "19 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.9 milligram of sodium"}}
