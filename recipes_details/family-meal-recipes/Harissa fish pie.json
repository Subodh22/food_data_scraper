{"title": "Harissa fish pie", "time": 105, "yields": "0 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["700g sweet potatoes (3-4 small ones or 2 large ones)", "3 tbsp rapeseed oil", "pinch of cumin", "pinch of smoked paprika", "1 onion, finely chopped", "1 red pepper, finely chopped", "350ml semi-skimmed milk", "350g fish pie mix (make sure it contains smoked haddock)", "225g frozen king prawns, defrosted", "2\u00bd tbsp harissa paste", "2 tbsp cornflour", "30ml double cream", "200g spinach, roughly chopped", "steamed green beans, to serve"], "instructions": "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Prick the sweet potatoes with a fork and cook for 50 mins-1 hr or until the flesh is soft (or in the microwave on high for 5-7 mins). Remove the skin and mash the flesh with 2 tbsp of the oil, the cumin and paprika. Set aside and keep warm.\nMeanwhile, heat a frying pan with the remaining 1 tbsp oil, and cook the onions and peppers over a medium heat until soft, about 7 mins. Warm the milk in a pan over a low-medium heat and add the fish pie mix and the prawns. Cook for 4 mins until the prawns have just turned pink, then scoop out the fish and prawns. Reserve the milk.\nAdd the harissa paste to the onions and peppers and cook for 2 mins. Stir through the cornflour, then add the reserved milk bit by bit, stirring as you go, followed by the cream. Add the spinach and cook for 2 mins until it softens, then add the fish and prawns, stirring carefully to avoid breaking them up.\nPour the fish mixture into an ovenproof dish, approximately 25 x 18cm. Carefully spoon the sweet potato on top, going from end- to-end and meeting in the middle. Carefully spread out with a knife, then go over it with a fork to make ridges. Bake for 20 mins, then grill for 10 mins on the hottest setting. Serve with the green beans.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/03/Harissa-fish-pie-9a1d880.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "539 calories", "fatContent": "20 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "52 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "27 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "9 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "34 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.1 milligram of sodium"}}
