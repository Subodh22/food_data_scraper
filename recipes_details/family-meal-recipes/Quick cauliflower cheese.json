{"title": "Quick cauliflower cheese", "time": 30, "yields": "6 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["100g mature cheddar, grated", "50g fresh white breadcrumbs", "handful flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped", "1 large cauliflower, cut into florets", "1l full-fat milk, plus a splash", "1 small onion, halved", "85g butter", "85g plain flour"], "instructions": "In a small bowl, mix the cheese with the breadcrumbs and parsley, and set aside. Put the cauliflower florets in a large saucepan, cover with water and a splash of milk (this stops the cauliflower smelling) and bring to the boil. Cook for 2-3 mins until tender, then drain.\nIn a separate saucepan, pour in the milk, add the onion and some seasoning, bring to the boil, then take off the heat. In a small saucepan, make a roux by melting the butter slowly, then adding the flour, stirring to make a paste. While still over a low heat, add the boiled milk, discarding the onion. Using a whisk, beat the milk together with the roux and bring to the boil. Cook for 2 mins until the sauce is lovely and thick \u2013 make sure the heat is not too high, otherwise it will catch on the bottom and burn.\nHeat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Transfer the cooked cauliflower to a casserole dish, pour over the sauce and top with the cheese and breadcrumb mix. Bake in the oven for 20 mins until golden and bubbling.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/cauliflower-cheese-1acaef2.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "403 calories", "fatContent": "25 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "11 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "15 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.8 milligram of sodium"}}
