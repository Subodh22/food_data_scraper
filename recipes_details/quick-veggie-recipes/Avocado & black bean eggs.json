Once they start to set, spoon the beans (with their juice) and the tomatoes around the pan and sprinkle over the cumin seeds. You\u2019re aiming to warm the beans and tomatoes rather than cook them.\nRemove the pan from the heat and scatter over the avocado and coriander. Squeeze over half of the lime wedges. Serve with the remaining wedges on the side for squeezing over.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/avocado_blackbean_eggs-9b605bb.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "356 calories", "fatContent": "20 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "5 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "11 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "20 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.8 milligram of sodium"}}
