Put a spoonful of the mascarpone mix under the skin of each breast. Wrap 2 slices of prosciutto around each, as neatly and tightly as you can, to keep the filling enclosed.\nHeat a non-stick frying pan, add the olive oil and quickly brown the chicken on both sides. Transfer to a roasting tin, then finish off in the oven for 15-20 mins until just cooked.\nAdd the lemon juice to the roasting tin and stir over the heat, scraping off any crispy bits. Spoon the juices over the chicken and serve with potatoes and green beans.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-160495_11-4be689d.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "339 calories", "fatContent": "20 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "2 grams sugar", "proteinContent": "37 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.24 milligram of sodium"}}
