Garnish with the lemon slice and blackberry, if using. 3 TWISTS Fresh fruit bramble This drink is one to make when the hedgerows are groaning with ripe fruit. Start by muddling 6 blackberries in a rocks glass. Add 50ml gin, 25ml lemon juice, 25ml sugar syrup and fill the glass two thirds full with crushed ice. Mix with a long-handled spoon. Top with more crushed ice, a garnish and paper straws. Bramble royale Go glam with your bramble by adding a splash of champagne to the mix. Just make the drink as normal but reduce the amount of crushed ice by about a third to leave room for the fizz. Then top with 25-50ml of champagne, mix gently, add a bit more crushed ice, garnish and serve. Peach sour The classic \u2018sour\u2019 formula that the bramble sticks to is easy to adapt by switching out the liqueur. Try 12.5ml of cr\u00e8me de peche instead of cr\u00e8me de mure \u2013 it might not look quite as eye-catching as the bloodshot bramble but it will taste just as delicious.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/bramble-baa53ba.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "222 calories", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "14 grams sugar", "sodiumContent": "0.1 milligram of sodium"}}
