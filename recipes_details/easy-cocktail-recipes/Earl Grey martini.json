{"title": "Earl Grey martini", "time": 5, "yields": "700 item(s)", "ingredients": ["1 tbsp good loose-leaf Earl Grey tea", "700ml bottle of decent gin", "ice"], "instructions": "Put the Earl Grey tea in a large jug. Pour the gin over and stir with a long-handled spoon for about 45 secs.\nStrain the gin through a tea strainer over a funnel back into the bottle. You\u2019ll see small particles of leaf still suspended in the gin. Rinse out the jug and, using a coffee filter or some muslin inside the funnel, strain the gin a second time to remove all the particles. In this way, the gin will be stable and the flavour won\u2019t change \u2013 it\u2019ll be good for months and months until the final sip.\nTo serve, shake or stir over ice \u2013 I like how the flavours change as the drink dilutes.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/earl-grey-martini-d966b7e.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "55 calories"}}
