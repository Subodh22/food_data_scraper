Add the flowers, top with the lemon peel and pour over the vodka. Submerge the elderflowers with a circle of baking parchment and seal with a lid. Leave to infuse for at least 48 hrs or up to 1 week.\nOnce infused, line a sieve with kitchen paper and set over a large bowl. Pour in the vodka, then discard the strained berries and flowers.\nTip the sugar into a pan with 350ml water and gently heat until the sugar has dissolved. Turn up the heat, bring to a simmer and cook until syrupy and reduced by half \u2013 about 10 mins. Cool to room temperature, then add 100ml to the elderflower liquor. Stir well and taste, adding more until you are happy with the sweetness.\nDecant the vodka into bottles and store in a cool, dark place. It will keep for years, but the flavour will diminish after a year.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/elderflower-gooseberry-vodka-1a03bff.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "70 calories", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "3 grams sugar"}}
