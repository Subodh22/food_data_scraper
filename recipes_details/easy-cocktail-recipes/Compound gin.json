{"title": "Compound gin", "time": 5, "yields": "700 item(s)", "ingredients": ["700ml bottle good quality vodka (we used a rye vodka)", "2 tbsp juniper berries", "6 cardamom pods", "pinch dried rose petals", "1 tsp coriander seeds", "strip of lemon peel"], "instructions": "Open the bottle of vodka and add the rest of the ingredients. For a stronger flavour it\u2019s a good idea to bruise the cardamom pods and juniper berries in a pestle and mortar first. Put the lid back on the bottle and leave in a cool dark place for 24 hrs.\nStrain the infused mixture into a jug through a sieve lined with coffee filter paper, then pour back into the bottle to store. Will keep for months in a cool dark place. Use as you would any gin, so great with tonic or in a Martini.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/gin-bf821f3.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "59 calories"}}
