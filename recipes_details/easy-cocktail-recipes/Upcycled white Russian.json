Pour over the rum, cover and steep for 24 hrs. Once infused, strain the rum into a jug through a sieve lined with kitchen paper, then stir in the maple syrup.\nTo make the cocktail, take four tumblers and pour 25ml of the coffee rum into each one, then top up with ice cubes. In a jug, mix together the seeds from the vanilla pod (keep the pods for the garnish), the double cream and the vodka. Put a spoon on top of the ice in the glass, then pour a quarter of the boozy cream very slowly onto the spoon so that it overflows into the glass below. This will slow it down and help the cream layer to float on top of the coffee liqueur below. Repeat with the remaining three glasses, then garnish each one with a piece of vanilla pod and serve with a stirrer.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/upcycled-white-russian-10a0894.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "329 calories", "fatContent": "20 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "2 grams sugar", "proteinContent": "0.6 grams protein"}}
