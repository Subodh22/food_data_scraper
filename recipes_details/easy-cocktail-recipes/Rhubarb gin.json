{"title": "Rhubarb gin", "time": 10, "yields": "2 item(s)", "ingredients": ["1kg pink rhubarb stalks", "400g caster sugar (don't use golden - it muddies the colour)", "800ml gin"], "instructions": "Wash the rhubarb, trim the stalks and discard the base and any leaves. Cut the stalks into 3cm lengths. Put in a large jar with the sugar. Shake everything around, put the lid on and leave overnight. The sugar will draw the juice out of the rhubarb.\nAfter 24 hrs, add the gin, seal and shake everything around. Leave for about 4 weeks before drinking. You can strain the liquor off through a muslin-lined sieve and transfer to a bottle, but I often just leave the rhubarb and booze in the jar and ladle it into drinks that way. Over time the rhubarb and the gin go a much paler colour \u2013 this doesn\u2019t look as dramatic. The upside is you that have to get through it fairly quickly!", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/rhubarb-gin-93e56de.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "63 calories", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "7 grams sugar"}}
