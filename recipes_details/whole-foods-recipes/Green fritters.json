Add the flour, mix again and season.\nHeat the oil in a non-stick frying pan. Put a large serving spoon of the mixture in the pan, then add 2 more spoonfuls so you have 3 fritters. Leave for 3-4 mins on a medium heat until golden brown on one side and solid enough for you to flip over, then flip over and leave to go golden on the other side. Repeat to make 3 more fritters (there is no need to add any more oil to the pan after the first batch). Scatter with the remaining dill to serve.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/courgette-fritters-c332ad2.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "359 calories", "fatContent": "21 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "2 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "16 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.5 milligram of sodium"}}
