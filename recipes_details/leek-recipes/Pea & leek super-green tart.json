{"title": "Pea & leek super-green tart", "time": 45, "yields": "6 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["plain flour, for dusting", "350g pastry , you can use puff or shortcrust, either a block or pre-rolled", "\u00bd tsp butter", "1 large or 2 small leeks , cut into \u00bd cm rounds", "125ml whipping cream", "1 large egg", "150g frozen spinach , defrosted", "200g peas", "4 mozzarella pearls"], "instructions": "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and put a baking sheet in the oven to heat up. Lightly dust a surface with flour, then roll out the pastry into a circle. Use to line a 22cm tart tin (3cm deep) with a removable base. Trim away any excess pastry that hangs over the top and chill while you make the filling.\nHeat the butter in a frying pan, add the leek in a single layer and fry for a minute, then add 50ml water and cover with a lid. Cook over a low heat for 4 mins (check it doesn\u2019t dry out). Whisk the cream and egg together, then mix in the spinach and peas.\nTip the pea mixture into the base of the tart and arrange the leek on top. (If you don\u2019t want the leeks on top, then stir them through the pea mixture.) Break the mozzarella pearls in half and dot them over the tart. Put the tart on the baking sheet and bake for 30 mins, or until the filling is cooked through. Leave to rest for 5 mins before cutting.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/pea-leek-super-green-tart-adea7b7.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "417 calories", "fatContent": "30 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "4 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "5 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "12 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.7 milligram of sodium"}}
