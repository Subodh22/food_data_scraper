{"title": "Leek & goat's cheese tartlets", "time": 65, "yields": "4 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["4 leeks , trimmed, halved and finely sliced", "large knob of butter", "2 tbsp thyme leaves and 4 nice sprigs", "375g block puff pastry", "4 slices goat's cheese (with a rind)", "truffle oil or walnut oil (optional)"], "instructions": "Wash the leeks in a colander but don\u2019t worry about drying them as you want a bit of water clinging on. Heat the butter in a wide saucepan until sizzling, then add the wet leeks and thyme leaves plus salt and pepper. Sweat the leeks really gently for 20-25 mins until they have practically melted but not coloured, adding a little more butter if needed. Set aside and allow to cool.\nHeat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Roll the pastry out to the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Cut out 4 saucer-size circles and place on a baking sheet. Spread the leeks over the circles leaving a slight border around the edge. Put a slice of goat\u2019s cheese in the middle of each tart and top with a thyme sprig. Pinch the pastry edge together to slightly encase the leeks, then bake the tarts for 25 mins until puffed up and golden. Serve hot and drizzled with flavoured oil if you have it.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-135455_12-28047ce.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "606 calories", "fatContent": "46 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "24 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "4 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "18 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.82 milligram of sodium"}}
