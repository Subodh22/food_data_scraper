{"title": "Glamorgan sausages", "time": 50, "yields": "12 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["50g butter", "2 large leeks, sliced", "400g fresh soft white fine breadcrumbs", "2 tsp thyme leaves", "4 large eggs, separated", "400g Caerphilly or strong mature cheddar, finely grated", "1 heaped tbsp wholegrain or Dijon mustard or 2 tsp English mustard", "50g plain flour, for dusting", "100ml vegetable oil for frying, plus a little extra if required"], "instructions": "Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat until foaming, then fry the leeks with a pinch of salt for 5-10 mins until soft. Leave to cool slightly.\nPut 200g soft breadcrumbs, the thyme, egg yolks, cheese, mustard and a generous grinding of pepper in a bowl and mix to combine. Stir in the fried leeks, and any butter left in the pan. Season with salt and mix well using your hands.\nMould the mixture into 12 sausages (divide and weigh for accuracy if you like). You may find damp hands help, cleaning your hands every so often to stop them sticking. Transfer to a baking tray lined with baking parchment and freeze for 10 mins until firm, or chill for 30 mins in the fridge.\nWhile the sausages are firming up, whisk the egg whites in a shallow bowl with a pinch of salt until lightly foamy. Put the flour and some of the remaining breadcrumbs onto separate plates.\nDust the chilled and firm sausages in the flour, then dunk in the egg white, and roll in the breadcrumbs. Top up the plate of breadcrumbs as required. Chill for at least 1 hr and up to 24hrs before frying.\nHeat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium high heat. Fry the sausages in batches, turning them gently every minute, for 4-6 mins, until golden and crisp all over. Add a little more oil between batches if you need to. Transfer to a baking tray, and bake for 10 mins. If you are freezing the sausages, once they're golden brown transfer to a tray and leave to cool for a few minutes, then open-freeze (uncovered) until solid and transfer to freezer-proof containers. Will keep frozen for up to three months. Cook from frozen in the oven for 25 mins until piping hot.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/03/Glamorgan-sausages-245ac2b.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "316 calories", "fatContent": "20 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "2 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "14 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.99 milligram of sodium"}}
