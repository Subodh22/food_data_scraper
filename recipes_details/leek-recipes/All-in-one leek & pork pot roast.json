{"title": "All-in-one leek & pork pot roast", "time": 135, "yields": "6 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["1kg boned and rolled shoulder joint of pork", "6 bay leaves", "2 garlic cloves , sliced", "bunch of thyme", "25g butter", "sunflower oil", "2 onions , peeled and cut into wedges", "5 juniper berries , crushed", "1 tsp golden caster sugar", "1 tbsp white wine vinegar", "4 whole leeks , trimmed then each cut into 3", "250ml white wine"], "instructions": "Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. I like to untie and unroll the joint then lay 4 bay leaves, the sliced garlic and half the thyme sprigs through it, then retie it. If you\u2019re not confident doing this then stab the meat all over and stuff the garlic, bay and thyme into the slits.\nHeat the butter and 1 tbsp oil in a casserole, then spend about 10 mins browning the pork on all sides. Add the onions, then continue to cook for about 5 mins until they start to soften. Add the juniper berries, scatter with sugar and add the vinegar. Simmer for a sec, then tuck the leeks and the rest of the bay and thyme in among the pork. Pour over the wine, cover, then cook in the oven for 1\u00bd-1\u00be hrs until the meat is tender. The dish may now be cooled, then frozen for up to 1 month. Lift the meat from the pan to a board.\nSeason the veg, then use a slotted spoon to lift it into a bowl. Taste the sauce and, if you think it needs it, reduce to intensify the flavour. Serves slices of meat with a bowl of vegetables and the sauce on the side.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-513796_11-897ac0e.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "470 calories", "fatContent": "33 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "7 grams sugar", "proteinContent": "32 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.36 milligram of sodium"}}
