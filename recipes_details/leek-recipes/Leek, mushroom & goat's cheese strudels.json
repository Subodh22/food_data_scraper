{"title": "Leek, mushroom & goat's cheese strudels", "time": 60, "yields": "4 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["500g leeks , thinly sliced", "150ml low-sodium vegetable stock", "175g chestnut mushroom , sliced", "4 large sheets filo pastry", "1 tbsp olive oil", "85g soft-rinded goat's cheese or vegetarian alternative", "1 tsp poppy seeds"], "instructions": "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the leeks and stock into a large pan, then cover and cook for 5-8 mins until starting to soften. Add the mushrooms, cover again and cook for 3 mins, then remove the lid and continue to cook until the juices have evaporated. Tip the veg onto a large plate to cool slightly.\nFor each strudel, lightly brush half of each filo sheet with some olive oil. Fold the un-brushed side over to make a smaller sheet, 2 layers thick. Brush the edges with a little more oil, then spoon a quarter of the veg along one edge. Crumble over a quarter of the cheese, fold over the pastry edges, then roll up to seal in the filling.\nPut the strudels on a baking tray, brush with any remaining oil and scatter over the poppy seeds. Bake for 25 mins until crisp and golden brown.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-463675_12-91d0292.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "213 calories", "fatContent": "11 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "4 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "10 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.52 milligram of sodium"}}
