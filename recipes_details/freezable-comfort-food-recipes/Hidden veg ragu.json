Blitz until finely chopped. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, and fry the veg mix until soft and translucent, about 20 mins.\nMeanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a second pan and fry all the mince until starting to brown, about 15-20 mins. Stir the vinegar into the mince, then season and stir into the fried vegetable mix.\nTip in the tomatoes, passata, tomato pur\u00e9e and stock. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 1 hr.
