{"title": "IPA treacle tart", "time": 140, "yields": "10 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["250g plain flour , plus extra for dusting", "125g unsalted butter , chilled and chopped", "75g icing sugar", "2 egg yolks", "700g golden syrup", "50g honey", "250g breadcrumbs", "\u00bd grapefruit , zest only", "100ml red IPA (we used Siren Liquid Mistress)", "3 medium eggs", "honeycomb , broken into shards (optional)"], "instructions": "To make the pastry, put the flour and butter in a bowl and rub together with your fingertips until it resembles breadcrumbs. Mix in the icing sugar followed by the yolks. If the pastry feels too dry, add 2 tbsp water. Shape into a ball, flatten it out into a disc, wrap it in cling film, then chill for 30 mins.\nRoll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface until big enough to line a 23cm fluted tart tin, about 3cm deep. Line the tin with the pastry, allowing the edges to overhang. Chill for another 30 mins.\nHeat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line the tart with baking parchment and baking beans. Bake blind for 20 mins. Remove the beans and parchment and bake for 10-15 mins more until the pastry is golden and crisp.\nWhile the pastry is cooking, mix the golden syrup, honey, breadcrumbs, grapefruit zest, beer and eggs together in a large jug or bowl.\nLower oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Use a small serrated knife to trim the pastry edges, then fill with the treacle mixture. Bake for 55 mins-1 hr until golden. Scatter over the honeycomb shards before serving, if you like.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/ipa-treacle-tart-0b00036.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "539 calories", "fatContent": "14 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "94 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "65 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "8 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.8 milligram of sodium"}}
