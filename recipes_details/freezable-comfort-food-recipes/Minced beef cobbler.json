{"title": "Minced beef cobbler", "time": 70, "yields": "4 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["500g pack extra-lean beef mince", "1 onion , finely chopped", "140g baby chestnut mushroom , halved", "2 tbsp plain flour", "500ml beef stock", "few shakes Worcestershire sauce", "140g self-raising flour", "1 tbsp chopped thyme", "4 tbsp low-fat natural yogurt", "140g frozen peas"], "instructions": "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Dry-fry the mince and onion in a large non-stick frying pan over a high heat. Stir frequently to break up the mince, until well browned. Add the mushrooms and plain flour, followed by the stock and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a simmer, then gently cook for 10 mins.\nMeanwhile, to make the cobbles, mix the self-raising flour and thyme together in a bowl. Stir in the yogurt with enough cold water to form a scone-like dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll out to the thickness of about 1.5cm and use a cutter to stamp out 12 x 5cm rounds.\nStir the peas into the mince mixture, then transfer to a baking dish. Randomly place the cobbles on top of the mince, then bake for 20-25 mins, until cobbles are risen and golden brown. This is good served with horseradish sauce.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-431456_11-636163b.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "349 calories", "fatContent": "7 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "5 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "35 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1 milligram of sodium"}}
