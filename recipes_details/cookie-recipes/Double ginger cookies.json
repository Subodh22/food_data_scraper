Stir in the chopped stem ginger.\nBeat together the egg and syrup, pour into the dry ingredients and stir, then knead with your hands to make a dough. Cut the dough in half and shape each piece into a thick sausage about 6cm across, making sure that the ends are straight. Wrap in cling film and chill for 20 mins. You can now freeze all or part of the dough for 2 months.\nHeat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line 2 baking sheets with baking parchment. Thickly slice each sausage into 12 and put the slices on the baking sheets, spacing them well apart and reshaping any, if necessary, to make rounds. Bake for 12 mins, then leave to cool for a few mins to harden before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.\nMelt the chocolate in a bowl over a pan of gently simmering water, making sure that the water isn\u2019t touching the bottom of the bowl. Dip half of each cookie into the chocolate \u2013 you may need to spoon it over when you get to the final few. Decorate with a slice of ginger, if you like, and leave to set. Will keep for 1 week in an airtight container.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/double-ginger-cookies-f9444b7.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "180 calories", "fatContent": "7 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "13 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "2 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.2 milligram of sodium"}}
