{"title": "Coconut cookies", "time": 35, "yields": "16 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["200g unsalted butter, softened", "75g caster sugar", "75g light brown soft sugar", "1 tsp vanilla bean paste", "1 large egg", "275g plain flour", "125g desiccated coconut, toasted and cooled", "100g dark chocolate"], "instructions": "Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Beat the butter in a large bowl using an electric whisk or in a stand mixer until very soft. Beat in both sugars and the vanilla until light and fluffy, then beat in the egg until just combined. Sift in the flour and a pinch of salt and stir to combine. Fold in 100g of the toasted coconut.\nRoll the dough into 14-16 balls (about 45g each) and arrange on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment, well spaced apart. Flatten each slightly using the palm of your hand and bake for 12-15 mins until golden brown and slightly firm to the touch. Leave to cool on the sheet briefly, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nBreak the chocolate into pieces and tip into a heatproof bowl, then melt in 20-second bursts in the microwave. Or set the bowl over a pan of simmering water, ensuring the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the water, stirring until smooth. Dip one half of each cookie into the melted chocolate, then lay on a sheet of baking parchment and sprinkle with the remaining toasted coconut. Leave to set for about 30 mins.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/04/Coconut-cookies-9d3b1ad.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "285 calories", "fatContent": "18 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "12 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "3 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.03 milligram of sodium"}}
