{"title": "Fruity flapjack cookies", "time": 60, "yields": "12 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["125g jumbo oats", "150g softened butter", "100g light muscovado sugar", "1 egg", "1 tbsp golden syrup", "\u00bd tsp vanilla extract", "100g self-raising flour", "100g mixed dried fruit or raisins", "75g dried apricots, finely chopped", "50g desiccated coconut", "\u00bd tsp ground cinnamon (optional)"], "instructions": "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Scatter the oats over a baking tray and bake for 20 mins, turning once until lightly browned. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. Tip the butter and sugar into a bowl and beat with an electric whisk for 2 mins until fluffy. Crack in the egg and add the golden syrup and vanilla, then beat until completely combined. Scatter in the flour, all the dried fruit, the coconut, cinnamon (if using), the toasted oats and a pinch of salt. Beat again until everything is combined and you have a thick dough. Use the dough straightaway or cover and chill for up to two days.\nLine two baking sheets with baking parchment and arrange six large spoonfuls of dough on each, well- spaced apart. Bake for 15 mins (or 18-20 mins if the dough is fridge-cold) until the cookies have spread and are brown at the edges but soft in the middle. Leave to cool on the baking sheet for 5 mins, then transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool completely. Will keep in an airtight container or tin for up to five days.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/09/Fruity-flapjack-cookies-173ad8f.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "247 calories", "fatContent": "12 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "18 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "3 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.4 milligram of sodium"}}
