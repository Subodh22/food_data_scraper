Stir in the flour, bicarbonate of soda, oats, cinnamon, dried fruits and ginger, then the water and finally the egg. Leave to cool until easy to handle.\nWith dampened hands, shape the mixture into 18 large balls, then flatten them onto the baking sheets \u2013 allowing plenty of space for spreading \u2013 and bake for 15-20 mins until golden. (This will give a soft, chewy cookie. For a crisper one, reduce the heat to 160C/fan140C/gas 3 and bake for a further 5-10 mins.)\nAllow the cookies to cool on the trays briefly, then lift onto to a cooling rack. Will keep in an airtight container, separated with baking parchment, for up to 1 week.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-45809_12-2d72a47.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "236 calories", "fatContent": "10 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "13 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "3 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.3 milligram of sodium"}}
