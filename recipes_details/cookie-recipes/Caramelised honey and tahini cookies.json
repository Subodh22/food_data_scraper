{"title": "Caramelised honey and tahini cookies", "time": 30, "yields": "18 item(s)", "ingredients": ["150g honey", "150g salted butter , cubed", "75g dark brown soft sugar", "75g caster sugar", "100g tahini", "1 large egg , plus 1 large yolk", "250g plain flour", "\u00bc tsp bicarbonate of soda", "1 tsp sea salt flakes", "1 tbsp mixed black & white sesame seeds"], "instructions": "Bring the honey to a boil in a small pan set over a medium-high heat. Boil for 5 mins until it has darkened and smells nutty \u2013 don\u2019t worry if it looks quite dark, this will add flavour. Whisk briefly, then remove from the heat and carefully whisk in the butter until melted. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and leave to cool.\nTip both the sugars, tahini, egg and yolk into the bowl with the honey mix, then beat to combine. In a separate bowl, mix the flour and bicarb together, then gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix until it comes together into a dough. Chill for 3 hrs, or overnight.\nHeat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking trays with baking parchment. Roll the dough into 18 even balls (weigh for accuracy, if you like \u2013 they should be around 45g each), and arrange on the trays spaced 5cm apart. Gently press down with the back of a spoon to slightly flatten the tops, then sprinkle over the sea salt flakes and sesame seeds and bake for 10-12 mins.\nTap the tray on a work surface to slightly flatten the cookies. Leave to cool on the trays for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Will keep in an airtight container for up to three days.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/honey-and-tahini-cookies-c76e5fe.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "217 calories", "fatContent": "11 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "14 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "3 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.5 milligram of sodium"}}
