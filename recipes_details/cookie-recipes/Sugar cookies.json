{"title": "Sugar cookies", "time": 30, "yields": "22 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["100g unsalted butter, softened", "100g caster sugar", "2 eggs", "1tsp vanilla extract", "30g cornflour", "300g plain flour"], "instructions": "Beat the butter and sugar with an electric whisk for 4 mins until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then add the vanilla. Whisk in the cornflour and plain flour until the mixture comes together into a dough. Put the dough between two pieces of baking parchment, and roll out to a 6mm thickness using a rolling pin. Chill for 30 mins.\nHeat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Peel the top layer of parchment off the dough and stamp out circles using a 6cm round cutter (or the shape of your choice). Re-roll any offcuts and continue stamping out rounds until all the dough is used. Transfer the cookies to a second large baking sheet lined with baking parchment, spacing them 2cm apart (you may need two sheets). Bake for 7-10 mins. Leave to cool on the sheet for 15 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Will keep in an airtight container for one week.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/09/Sugar-cookies-4d3bae9.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "130 calories", "fatContent": "5 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "6 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "2 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.03 milligram of sodium"}}
