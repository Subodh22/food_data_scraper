Using a food mixer or electric whisk beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add in the egg and whisk to combine then beat in the flour, cocoa powder, salt and chocolate chunks until fully incorporated. Using a spoon swirl the peanut butter through the cookie dough.\nScoop the dough into 12 large cookies onto the two trays using a dessert spoon, leaving plenty of room between each cookie as they'll spread. Bake in the oven for 9-10 mins until still soft and melty in the middle. They will look underbaked but will harden once cool. Drizzle over the melted milk chocolate and top with a few chopped peanuts and a pinch of flaky sea salt. Serve with a glass of milk for dunking.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/double-choc-peanut-butter-cookies-36993db.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "328 calories", "fatContent": "19 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "26 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "6 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.4 milligram of sodium"}}
