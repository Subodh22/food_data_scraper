Scatter over the chocolate chips and stir until they are rippled throughout the dough.\nRoll into a big round cookie and place onto a large baking sheet covered with parchment. If the dough feels very soft at this stage pop it in the fridge for 30 mins to firm up. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 mins until golden at the edges and still a little wobbly in the middle. Leave to cool for a couple of mins before topping. Spread the melted chocolate over the cookie, sprinkle with giant chocolate buttons, mini marshmallows and strawberries. Cut into about 15 slices and serve while it is still a little warm.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/cookie-dough-pizza-a872d07.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "432 calories", "fatContent": "21 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "36 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "5 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.8 milligram of sodium"}}
