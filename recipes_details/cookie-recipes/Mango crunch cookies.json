{"title": "Mango crunch cookies", "time": 30, "yields": "14 item(s)", "ingredients": ["140g butter , at room temperature", "50g golden caster sugar", "1 egg yolk", "1 tsp vanilla extract", "1 tbsp maple syrup", "100g dried mango , roughly chopped", "175g plain flour , plus extra for dusting", "200g icing sugar , sifted", "3 tbsp mango juice", "sprinkles"], "instructions": "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Place the butter and sugar in a food processor and blitz until smooth and creamy. Add the egg yolk, vanilla, maple syrup and mango. Whizz to blend in and chop the mango a little more finely. Add the flour and briefly blitz to form a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and shape into a ball. Chill for 20 mins.\nUsing a rolling pin, roll the cookie dough to the thickness of a \u00a31 coin on a lightly floured surface, then cut out biscuit shapes with a 10cm cutter for large, or a 5cm cutter for smaller cookies.\nTransfer to a baking tray lined with baking parchment, and cook for 12-15 mins or until lightly golden and firm. Remove and leave to cool on a wire rack.\nIf decorating, mix the icing sugar with the mango juice to make a runny icing. Drizzle or spoon the icing over the biscuits, then add the sprinkles if using, and leave to set. Will keep in a biscuit tin for up to 1 week.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/biscuits_1-ba117bb.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "156 calories", "fatContent": "5 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "1 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "8 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "2 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.2 milligram of sodium"}}
