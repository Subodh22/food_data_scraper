Put the sugar, honey and butter in a large pan and gently melt together. When all the sugar has dissolved stir in the coconut, flaked almonds, sliced cherries and flour.\nLine a large baking tray with greaseproof paper (about 40 x 30cm), and roughly spread the Florentine mixture out to a thin layer \u2013 don\u2019t worry if you have small gaps, it should melt together in the oven. Bake for 10-12 mins until a rich golden colour, then set aside to cool and firm up.\nMelt the chocolate(s) all in separate heatproof bowls over gently simmering water. Line a second large tray or board with greaseproof paper and carefully flip the cooled Florentine bake onto it. Peel off the greaseproof paper. Spread the melted chocolate over, if you\u2019re using a few types just leave a gap between each.\nLeave aside until set, then stamp out shapes using cookie star cutters - if the cutter is digging into your hands (as the Florentine mix may be a little hard), rest a small plate or pan on top of it and push down on this instead.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-1179459_12-a6cd7f4.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "247 calories", "fatContent": "15 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "25 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "2 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.15 milligram of sodium"}}
