Can be made 2 days ahead.\nHeat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line a couple of baking sheets with baking parchment, then scoop or roll plum-sized balls of the dough and place them on the baking sheets about 2cm apart. Flatten ever so slightly and sprinkle with a bit more flaky salt if you want. Cook on the middle shelf for 12-15 mins, turning the tray once, until the cookies have spread and are golden but still soft in the middle. Leave to cool slightly, then lift the cookies onto a cooling rack while you bake another batch. Will keep in a biscuit jar for up to 3 days.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/vegan_cookies-affe287.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "221 calories", "fatContent": "10 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "19 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "2 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.12 milligram of sodium"}}
