{"title": "Christmas crinkle cookies", "time": 30, "yields": "30 item(s)", "ingredients": ["60g cocoa powder, sieved", "200g caster sugar", "60ml vegetable oil", "2 large eggs", "180g plain flour", "1 tsp baking powder", "2 oranges, zested", "2 tsp mixed spice", "1 tsp cinnamon", "50g icing sugar"], "instructions": "Mix the cocoa, caster sugar and oil together. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking until fully combined.\nCombine the flour, baking powder, orange zest, mixed spice, cinnamon and a pinch of salt in a separate bowl, then add to the cocoa mixture and mix until a soft dough forms. If it feels too soft, put in the fridge to chill for 1 hr.\nHeat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and tip the icing sugar into a shallow dish. Roll heaped teaspoons of the dough into balls (about 20g each), then roll in the icing sugar to coat. Put the balls on one large or two medium baking trays lined with baking parchment, ensuring they\u2019re evenly spaced apart.\nBake on the middle rack of the oven for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool \u2013 they will firm up as they cool, but still be fudgy in the centre. Will keep for up to four days in an airtight container.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/09/Crinkle-cookies-d9f120f.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "88 calories", "fatContent": "3 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "1 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "8 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "2 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.06 milligram of sodium"}}
