Put the fish in a roasting tin, drizzle over some oil and cook for 10-15 mins until cooked through. Allow to cool, then flake into chunks, removing any skin and bones.\nFor the pesto, blitz together all the ingredients with a pinch each of salt and pepper, adding 1 tbsp water if it looks too thick.\nMix the fish, mashed potato, pesto, spring onion and egg with a little more seasoning, being careful not to break up the fish too much. Mix in 1-2 tbsp breadcrumbs if the mixture feels too wet. Shape into 6-8 cakes, put on a tray and chill in the fridge for 1 hr.\nFor the crumb, prepare a bowl of seasoned flour, a bowl of beaten egg and a bowl of breadcrumbs.
