{"title": "Healthy pancakes", "time": 45, "yields": "12 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["50g self-raising flour", "50g wholemeal or wholegrain flour", "2 small eggs, separated", "150ml skimmed milk", "berries and low-fat yogurt or fromage frais to serve"], "instructions": "Sift the flours into a bowl or wide jug and tip any bits in the sieve back into the bowl. Add the egg yolks and a splash of milk then stir to a thick paste. Add the remaining milk a little at a time so you don\u2019t make lumps in the batter.\nWhisk the egg whites until they stand up in stiff peaks, then fold them carefully into the batter \u2013 try not to squash out all the air.\nHeat a non-stick pan over a medium heat and pour in enough batter to make a pancake about 10 cm across. Cook for just under a minute until bubbles begin to pop on the surface and the edges are looking a little dry. Carefully turn the pancake over. If it is a bit wet on top, it may squirt out a little batter as you do so. In that case, leave it on the other side a little longer. Keep warm while you make the remaining pancakes. Serve with your favourite healthy toppings.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/healthy-fc28587.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "53 calories", "fatContent": "1 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "0.3 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "0.8 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "0.4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "3 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.1 milligram of sodium"}}
