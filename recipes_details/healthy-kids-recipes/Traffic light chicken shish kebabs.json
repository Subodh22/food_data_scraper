You can do this in advance if you like, and chill the kebabs until needed.\nHeat a barbecue to medium, or until a thin layer of coals has turned grey. Cook the kebabs for 10 mins, turning occasionally, until the chicken is charred and cooked through. Serve the kebabs with the reserved yogurt sauce, warmed flatbreads, chopped tomatoes and lemon wedges on the side.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/traffic-light-chicken-shish-kebabs-2f7fdad.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "304 calories", "fatContent": "8 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "10 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "44 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.4 milligram of sodium"}}
