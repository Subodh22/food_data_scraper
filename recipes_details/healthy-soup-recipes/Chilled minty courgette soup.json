{"title": "Chilled minty courgette soup", "time": 50, "yields": "4 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["2 tbsp olive oil", "1 onion , chopped", "1kg courgettes , roughly chopped", "\u00bd tsp dried mint", "1.3l vegetable stock (try Marigold vegetable bouillon powder)", "3-4 sprigs of fresh mint", "4 tbsp single cream"], "instructions": "Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the onion and cook gently for about 2-3 minutes until softened. Now add the courgettes and dried mint, and stir well to mix with the onion. Cover and cook over a gentle heat for about 10 minutes until the courgettes are softened but not coloured.\nPour in the stock and bring to the boil, then lower the heat to a gentle simmer. Strip the mint leaves off the stalks and drop them into the pan, then cover the pan and continue simmering gently for 20 minutes or until the courgettes are very tender. Remove from the heat and let the bubbles subside before blitzing in a food processor or blender until smooth (if you like a really smooth soup, simply pour it through a sieve after blitzing). Pour into a bowl and leave to cool, then cover and chill for at least 4 hours (or overnight).\nTo serve, taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve in chilled soup plates with a spoonful of cream drizzled in the middle.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-47733_11-27ffd72.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "152 calories", "fatContent": "10 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams carbohydrates", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "6 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.29 milligram of sodium"}}
