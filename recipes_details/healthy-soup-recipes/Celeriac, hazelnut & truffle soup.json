{"title": "Celeriac, hazelnut & truffle soup", "time": 65, "yields": "6 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["1 tbsp olive oil", "small bunch thyme", "2 bay leaves", "1 onion, chopped", "1 fat garlic clove, chopped", "1 celeriac (about 1kg), peeled and chopped", "1 potato (about 200g), chopped", "1l veg stock (check the label to ensure it\u2019s vegan \u2013 we used Marigold)", "100ml soya cream", "50g blanched hazelnuts, toasted and roughly chopped", "1 tbsp truffle oil, plus an extra drizzle to serve"], "instructions": "In a large saucepan, heat the oil over a low heat. Tie the thyme sprigs and bay leaves together with a piece of string and add them to the pan with the onion and a pinch of salt. Cook for about 10 mins until softened but not coloured.\nStir in the garlic and cook for 1 min more, then tip in the celeriac and potato. Give everything a good stir and season with a big pinch of salt and white pepper. Pour in the stock, bring to the boil, then simmer for around 30 mins until the vegetables are completely soft.\nDiscard the herbs, then stir through the cream, remove from the heat and blitz until completely smooth. Stir through 1/2 tbsp truffle oil at a time and taste for seasoning \u2013 the strength of the oil will vary, so it\u2019s better to start with less oil and add a little at a time.\nTo serve, reheat the soup until piping hot, then ladle into bowls and top with the hazelnuts, some black pepper and an extra drizzle of truffle oil.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/celeriac-soup-2e8bf4e.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "237 calories", "fatContent": "15 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "5 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "11 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "5 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.6 milligram of sodium"}}
