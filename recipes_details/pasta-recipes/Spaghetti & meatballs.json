Split the skins of the sausages and squeeze out the meat into a large mixing bowl.\nAdd the mince, onion, parsley, parmesan, breadcrumbs, eggs and lots of seasoning. Get your hands in and mix together really well \u2013 the more you squeeze and mash the mince, the more tender the meatballs will be.\nHeat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Roll the mince mixture into about 50 golf-ball-sized meatballs. Set aside any meatballs for freezing, allowing about five per portion, then spread the rest out in a large roasting tin \u2013 the meatballs will brown better if spaced out a bit.\nDrizzle with a little oil (about 1 tsp per portion), shake to coat, then roast for 20-30 mins until browned.\nMeanwhile, make the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the garlic cloves and sizzle for 1 min.\nStir in the chopped tomatoes, red wine, if using, caster sugar, parsley and seasoning. Simmer for 15-20 mins until slightly thickened.\nStir in a few basil leaves, if using, spoon out any portions for freezing, then add the cooked meatballs to the pan to keep warm while you cook the spaghetti in a pan of boiling, salted water.\nSpoon the sauce and meatballs over spaghetti, or stir them all together and serve with extra parmesan and a few basil leaves, if you like.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-1035708_10-fdc5ae0.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "870 calories", "fatContent": "37 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "95 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "13 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "5 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "46 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.3 milligram of sodium"}}
