{"title": "Creamy salmon pasta", "time": 30, "yields": "2 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["2 salmon fillets", "1 tbsp olive oil, plus 1 tsp if roasting", "175g penne", "2 shallots or 1 small onion, finely chopped", "1 garlic clove, crushed", "100ml white wine", "200ml double cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "\u00bc lemon, zested and juiced", "\u00bd small bunch dill, finely chopped"], "instructions": "You can either steam or roast the salmon, depending if you want to turn the oven on or not. To roast, heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6, place on a baking tray, drizzle with oil and roast for 12 mins until opaque and the flesh starts to flake when pressed. To steam, place the fillets skin-side down in a steamer, and steam over a pan of simmering water for 8-10 mins until cooked.\nWhile the salmon is cooking, boil the pasta for 10 mins until al dente, then drain, reserving 100ml of the pasta water.\nHeat the oil on a medium heat in a wide frying pan and fry the shallot for 6 mins until softened, but not turning golden. Add the garlic and fry for a minute more until fragrant. Add the wine, bubble for a few minutes until reduced by half, then add the cream and season well. Bring to a very gentle simmer.\nFlake the cooked salmon into big chunky pieces, leaving the skin behind. Add to the sauce with the cooked pasta. Add the lemon zest, a squeeze of the juice and most of the dill. Add a splash of the pasta water to the sauce to coat the pasta if you need to. Toss gently to keep the salmon in big pieces. Check the seasoning, if using double cream you may need a squeeze more lemon juice. Grind over some black pepper and scatter over the remaining dill. Serve with a green salad.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/07/Creamy-Salmon-Pasta-427f3b6.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "1140 calories", "fatContent": "77 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "38 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "61 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "6 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "6 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "39 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.23 milligram of sodium"}}
