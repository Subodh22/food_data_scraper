{"title": "Bacon & mushroom pasta", "time": 25, "yields": "4 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["400g penne (or other tube shape) pasta", "250g pack chestnut or button mushrooms, wiped clean", "8 rashers streaky bacon", "4 tbsp pesto (fresh from the chiller cabinet if possible)", "200ml carton 50% fat cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "handful basil leaves"], "instructions": "Cook the pasta in boiling water in a large non-stick saucepan according to pack instructions. Meanwhile, slice the mushrooms and snip the bacon into bite-size pieces with scissors or a sharp knife.\nReserve a few drops of the cooking water in a cup or bowl, then drain the pasta and set aside. Fry the bacon and mushrooms in the same pan until golden, about 5 mins. Keep the heat high so the mushrooms fry in the bacon fat, rather than sweat.\nTip the pasta and reserved water back into the pan and stir over the heat for 1 min. Take the pan off the heat, spoon in the pesto and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and most of the basil and stir to combine. Sprinkle with the remaining basil to serve.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-338805_11-7d3f970.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "567 calories", "fatContent": "20 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "78 grams carbohydrates", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "23 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.41 milligram of sodium"}}
