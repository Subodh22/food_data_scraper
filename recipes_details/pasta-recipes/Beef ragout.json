Heat 1 tbsp oil in a flameproof casserole over a medium-high heat and brown the beef until dark, about 15 mins, in batches if you need to, using 1 tbsp oil for each batch. Drain the beef in a colander to remove the fat while you cook the rest.\nWipe out the pan with kitchen paper, then add about 2 tbsp oil, the onions, carrots, celery and garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 mins over a low-medium heat. Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e and cook for a further 3 mins. Add the wine, herbs, tomatoes and stock, season and bring to the boil, stir the beef back into the sauce and reduce to a simmer. Cover and put in the oven for 2 hrs 30 mins, then remove the lid, stir and put back in the oven, uncovered, for 30 mins. Stir or use a fork to roughly shred the beef, and season. Serve now, or chill until serving \u2013 it tastes better if made a day ahead.\nWhen ready to serve, gently reheat the ragout over a medium heat. Cook the pasta in a large pan of salted water for 3 mins, drain then tip into the ragout, toss together with some of the parmesan and leave for 1 min. Ladle the pasta into bowls, scatter over the remaining parmesan and serve.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/beef-ragout-c9c8bd0.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "396 calories", "fatContent": "20 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "8 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "34 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.2 milligram of sodium"}}
