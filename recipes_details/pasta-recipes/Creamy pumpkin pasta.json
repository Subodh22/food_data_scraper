{"title": "Creamy pumpkin pasta", "time": 50, "yields": "4 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["2 tbsp olive oil", "1 onion, finely chopped", "2 garlic cloves, crushed", "500g pumpkin or squash, peeled and cut into roughly 3cm cubes", "50-100ml whole milk", "2 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e", "2 tbsp mascarpone", "350g short pasta (rigatoni or penne work well)", "40g grated parmesan or vegetarian alternative, plus extra to serve"], "instructions": "Heat the oil in a large, shallow, flameproof casserole or frying pan over a low-medium heat and fry the onion with a pinch of salt for 10-15 mins until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and fry for 1 min more. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly.\nMeanwhile, cook the pumpkin in a pan of boiling salted water for 10-15 mins until tender when pierced with a cutlery knife. Drain and tip into a blender (or use a hand blender). Blitz with 50ml milk and the onions until completely smooth, gradually adding more milk until the mixture is thick enough to just coat the back of a spoon (you may not need all the milk). Tip into a large frying pan with the tomato pur\u00e9e and mascarpone, and bring to a simmer over a low heat.\nCook the pasta in a large pan of boiling, salted water following pack instructions. Drain, reserving a cupful of the cooking water. Toss the pasta with the pumpkin sauce, parmesan and 50-100ml of the reserved water to loosen. Season and scatter with extra parmesan.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/09/Creamy-pumpkin-pasta-35ad888.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "461 calories", "fatContent": "14 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "63 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "7 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "8 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "16 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.2 milligram of sodium"}}
