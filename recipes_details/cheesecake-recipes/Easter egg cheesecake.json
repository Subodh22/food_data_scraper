Mix with the melted butter, then press into the base of the prepared cake tin and chill for 30 mins.\nRoughly chop half the chocolate mini eggs. Beat the soft cheese with the icing sugar and vanilla until just combined using an electric whisk. Clean the beaters, then beat the double cream to stiff peaks in a separate bowl. Gently fold the whipped cream into the soft cheese mixture along with the chopped chocolate mini eggs. Spoon the cheesecake mixture over the biscuit base, then smooth the surface with a palette knife or spatula. Chill overnight.\nThe next day, carefully release the cheesecake from the tin (you may need to run a cutlery knife around the edge to loosen it) and top with the remaining whole chocolate mini eggs to decorate.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/03/Easter-egg-cheesecake-56b2e83.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "637 calories", "fatContent": "47 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "29 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "37 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "5 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.61 milligram of sodium"}}
