Butter a loose-based 20cm cake tin and line the base with baking parchment. Break up the biscuits, then pulse to fine crumbs in a food processor. Melt the butter with the syrup, then stir into the crumbs until they are evenly damp. Tip into the prepared tin and smooth with the back of a dessertspoon. Bake for 10 mins, then leave to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2.\nTip the stoned cherries into the rinsed-out food processor with 85g of the sugar. Blend until smooth, then tip into a small pan and bring to the boil. Simmer for 5-6 mins, stirring, until it forms a thick syrup. Cool.\nRinse out the food processor again, then tip in the cheese, cornflour, eggs, remaining sugar, vanilla, orange and half the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Blend until smooth. Spoon half the mix into the tin, then spoon half the cherry pur\u00e9e evenly over the top. Spoon the remaining cheesecake mix over this. Stir the mix gently with a fine skewer to swirl the cherry pur\u00e9e through it. Bake for 45 mins, then turn the oven off and leave for 30 mins.\nSpread the remaining cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche over the filling, then spoon the remaining cherry pur\u00e9e into the centre. Using a fine skewer draw the cherry pur\u00e9e through the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche to make a star pattern, wiping the skewer each time. Set the reserved cherries around the edge of the cheesecake, then dust with icing sugar. Chill until ready to serve.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-10143_11-f2468a4.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "506 calories", "fatContent": "31 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "41 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "10 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.3 milligram of sodium"}}
