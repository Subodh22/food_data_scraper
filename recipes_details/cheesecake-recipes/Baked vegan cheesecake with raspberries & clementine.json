Leave to soften for 1 hr.\nHeat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line the base of a 20cm (4cm deep) round cake tin with baking parchment. To make the base, put the oats, sugar and a pinch of salt in a food processor and blitz to a fine powder. Pulse in the coconut oil until combined, then gradually pulse in 3-4 tbsp water until it comes together into a dough \u2013 it should be crumbly, not sticky.\nPress the dough into the base and up the side of the tin using the back of a spoon. Bake for 20-25 mins until golden. Leave to cool.\nReduce the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Drain the cashews, then transfer to a blender along with the coconut cream, soft cheese, cornflour, vanilla, maple syrup, coconut oil, lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Blitz on high speed until the mixture is creamy and smooth.\nPour the cashew and soft cheese mixture over the base and bake for 1 hr-1 hr 15 mins until the edge is just coloured and the centre has mostly set with just a slight wobble. Leave to cool completely (it will sink slightly as it cools), then chill for at least 3 hrs, or overnight.\nPut the raspberries and sugar in a heatproof bowl and microwave for 1 min 30 seconds on high. Stir and leave to cool completely, then pour this over the cheesecake. Scatter over the pistachios and candied clementine peel.
