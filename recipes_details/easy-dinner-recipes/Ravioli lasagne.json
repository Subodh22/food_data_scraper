{"title": "Ravioli lasagne", "time": 85, "yields": "2 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["oil , for frying", "6 sausages (we used Italian sausages with herbs and fennel)", "2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes with garlic & basil", "200g baby spinach", "500g spinach & ricotta ravioli (or any flavour you like)", "75g mixture of grated cheddar and mozzarella"], "instructions": "Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan. Squeeze the sausagemeat from the skins and fry until browned, using a wooden spoon to break it up. Add the tomatoes and half a can of water and season. Simmer for 20 mins.\nMeanwhile, put the spinach in a colander. Pour over boiled water from the kettle to wilt. Leave to cool, then squeeze out as much of the excess water as you can.\nHeat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Spoon a third of the sauce into a medium baking dish (about 18 x 20cm). Top with a third of the spinach and a third of the ravioli, then scatter over some of the cheese. Repeat the layers twice, making sure the final layer of ravioli is nestled into the sauce. Bake for 35-40 mins until bubbling and hot all the way through. Cover if the top starts to get too dark. Will keep in the freezer for up to two months.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/ravioli-lasagne-ff62ed4.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "789 calories", "fatContent": "43 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "15 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "9 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "36 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "2.5 milligram of sodium"}}
