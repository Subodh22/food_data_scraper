{"title": "Creamy chicken stew", "time": 65, "yields": "6 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["3 leeks , halved and finely sliced", "2 tbsp olive oil , plus extra if needed", "1 tbsp butter", "8 small chicken thighs", "500ml chicken stock", "1 tbsp Dijon mustard", "75g cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "200g frozen peas", "3 tbsp dried or fresh breadcrumbs", "small bunch of parsley , finely chopped"], "instructions": "Tip the leeks and oil into a flameproof casserole dish on a low heat, add the butter and cook everything very gently for 10 mins or until the leeks are soft.\nPut the chicken, skin-side down, in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, cook until the skin browns, then turn and brown the other side. You shouldn\u2019t need any oil but if the skin starts to stick, add a little. Add the chicken to the leeks, leaving behind any fat in the pan.\nAdd the stock to the dish and bring to a simmer, season well, cover and cook for 30 mins on low. Stir in the mustard, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and peas and bring to a simmer. You should have quite a bit of sauce.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to serve, put the grill on. Mix the breadcrumbs and parsley, sprinkle them over the chicken and grill until browned.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/chicken_stew-670d71c.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "400 calories", "fatContent": "27 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "4 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "26 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1 milligram of sodium"}}
