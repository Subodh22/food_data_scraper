Transfer to a plate and leave to cool. Peel the skin from the cooled aubergines or scoop out the flesh using a spoon. Try to remove most of the skin, but don\u2019t worry if a few flecks remain.\nHeat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Heat the olive oil in a large ovenproof frying pan with the bay leaf and cumin seeds. When they start to sizzle, add the onion and garlic. Fry for about 5 mins until fragrant but not coloured, then stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e and cook it down for a couple of mins.\nAdd the tomatoes and dried oregano, and cook for a few mins more until they have collapsed into the sauce. Add the aubergine flesh, chilli powder, chilli flakes and vinegar, and cook, stirring, for 1 min, then tip in the cans of black beans, one drained and one still with its liquid. Squeeze over a little of the lime juice and cook for 5 mins until reduced and bubbling, then transfer to the oven and roast for 15-20 mins until deep, dark and fully reduced.\nSeason with more lime juice, if you like, and spoon the aubergine mixture into the warm tortillas with the coriander, crumbled feta, lettuce and pink pickled onions to serve", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/aubergine_tacos-71e6008.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "518 calories", "fatContent": "15 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "65 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "11 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "20 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "21 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.6 milligram of sodium"}}
