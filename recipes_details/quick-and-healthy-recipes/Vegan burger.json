{"title": "Vegan burger", "time": 20, "yields": "4 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["1 shallot or \u00bd onion, chopped", "1 stick of celery , or \u00bc red pepper, chopped", "handful of parsley leaves", "400g can chickpeas , drained and left to dry a little", "1-2 tsp garam masala", "1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e", "2 tbsp plain flour", "1 tbsp polenta , couscous, or dried breadcrumbs", "oil , for frying", "burger buns or pitta bread, lettuce, tomato, and sauces to serve"], "instructions": "Whizz the shallot, celery, parsley and most of the chickpeas to a coarse paste. Don\u2019t overdo this, you want a texture slightly rougher than hummus. Mash the remaining chickpeas and stir them into the paste with the garam masala, tomato pur\u00e9e, flour and polenta. Season well.\nShape the mixture into four patties. Let them rest for at least 30 mins \u2013 you can leave them overnight in the fridge if you like. The polenta needs time to absorb any extra liquid.\nHeat a little oil in a non-stick frying pan and cook the patties until they\u2019re brown and crisp on each side. Try not to handle them too much as they\u2019ll be quite soft when warm. Slide into buns or pitta with the accompaniments that you\u2019d like.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/vegan-burger-f4eb0ad.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "190 calories", "fatContent": "8 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "1 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "1 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "5 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "6 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.04 milligram of sodium"}}
