{"title": "Chicken satay salad", "time": 25, "yields": "2 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["1tbsp tamari", "1tsp medium curry powder", "\u00bctsp ground cumin", "1 garlic clove, finely grated", "1tsp clear honey", "2 skinless chicken breast fillets (or use turkey breast)", "1tbsp crunchy peanut butter (choose a sugar-free version with no palm oil, if possible)", "1tbsp sweet chilli sauce", "1tbsp lime juice", "sunflower oil, for wiping the pan", "2 Little Gem lettuce hearts, cut into wedges", "\u00bc cucumber, halved and sliced", "1 banana shallot, halved and thinly sliced", "coriander, chopped", "seeds from \u00bd pomegranate"], "instructions": "Pour the tamari into a large dish and stir in the curry powder, cumin, garlic and honey. Mix well. Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally to make 4 fillets in total, then add to the marinade and mix well to coat. Set aside in the fridge for at least 1 hr, or overnight, to allow the flavours to penetrate the chicken.\nMeanwhile, mix the peanut butter with the chilli sauce, lime juice, and 1 tbsp water to make a spoonable sauce. When ready to cook the chicken, wipe a large non-stick frying pan with a little oil. Add the chicken and cook, covered with a lid, for 5-6 mins on a medium heat, turning the fillets over for the last min, until cooked but still moist. Set aside, covered, to rest for a few mins.\nWhile the chicken rests, toss the lettuce wedges with the cucumber, shallot, coriander and pomegranate, and pile onto plates. Spoon over a little sauce. Slice the chicken, pile on top of the salad and spoon over the remaining sauce. Eat while the chicken is still warm.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/chicken-satay-salad-8f5b068.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "353 calories", "fatContent": "10 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "21 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "7 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "38 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.6 milligram of sodium"}}
