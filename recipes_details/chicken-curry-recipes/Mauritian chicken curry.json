Drop in the curry leaves, onion, garlic, ginger, cinnamon stick, chilli and thyme and cook for 5 mins until the onion has softened, stirring regularly to prevent sticking to the pan.\nMix the curry powder with a splash of water in a bowl to make a runny paste. Add the paste to the pan and give it a good stir until aromatic, around 30 seconds. Keeping the heat on a low-medium simmer so that the spices don\u2019t burn, add the chicken pieces and stir to coat in the curry.\nAdd the chopped tomatoes, potatoes and 1 tsp salt. Pour in water to just below the level of the chicken and potatoes. Cook for around 25 mins until the potatoes and chicken are cooked through, then discard the cinnamon stick.\nTo make the satini pomme d\u2019amour, mix all the ingredients together in a bowl. Spoon the curry into bowls and scatter over the coriander leaves and red onion.
