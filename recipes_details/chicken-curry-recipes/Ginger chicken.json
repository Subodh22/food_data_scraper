{"title": "Ginger chicken", "time": 50, "yields": "6 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["1kg pack boneless skinless chicken thighs", "1 thumb-size piece of fresh ginger, peeled and very finely chopped", "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 tsp mild chilli powder", "15g pack fresh coriander, chopped", "juice of 1 lime", "2 tbsp sunflower oil", "2 medium onions", "1 tsp ground turmeric", "400ml can reduced-fat coconut milk", "1 fresh red chilli, deseeded and sliced", "1 chicken stock cube"], "instructions": "Slice each chicken thigh into 2 or 3 large chunks, then put in a bowl with the ginger, garlic, chilli powder, half the coriander, lime juice and 1 tbsp of the oil. Stir well, then cover and leave in the fridge to marinate until ready to cook. For the best flavour, do this in the morning or, better still, the night before.\nPeel and quarter the onions, then very finely chop them in a food processor; for a curry you want the onion really fine. Heat the remaining oil in a wok or large frying pan, then add the onion and stir-fry for about 8 mins until soft. Stir in the turmeric and cook for 1 min more, stirring well.\nTip in the chicken mixture with the marinade and cook over a high heat until the chicken changes colour. Pour in the coconut milk, add the chilli and stock, then cover and simmer for 20 mins until the chicken is tender. Stir in the remaining coriander, then serve with pilau rice, a bowl of mango chutney \u2013 we like Geeta\u2019s \u2013 and some poppadoms or naan bread.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-5116_11-a42028a.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "310 calories", "fatContent": "16 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "3 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "37 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.29 milligram of sodium"}}
