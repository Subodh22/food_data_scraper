{"title": "Spiced parsnip & cauliflower soup", "time": 65, "yields": "8 serving(s)", "ingredients": ["1 tbsp olive oil", "1 medium cauliflower , cut into florets", "3 parsnips , chopped", "2 onions , chopped", "1 tbsp fennel seed", "1 tsp coriander seed", "\u00bd tsp turmeric", "3 garlic cloves , sliced", "1-2 green chillies , deseeded and chopped", "5cm piece ginger , sliced", "zest and juice 1 lemon", "1l vegetable stock", "handful coriander , chopped"], "instructions": "Heat the oil in a large saucepan and add the vegetables. Cover partially and sweat slowly for 10-15 mins until soft but not brown. In a separate pan, dry-roast the spices with a pinch of salt for a few mins until fragrant. Grind with a pestle and mortar to a fine powder.\nAdd the garlic, chilli, ginger and spices to the vegetables, and cook for about 5 mins, stirring regularly. Add the lemon zest and juice. Pour in the stock, topping up if necessary to just cover the veg. Simmer for 25-30 mins until all the vegetables are tender.\nPur\u00e9e with a blender until smooth. Dilute the consistency with more water if needed, until you get a thick but easily pourable soup. Season generously, stir in the coriander and add more lemon juice to balance the taste. Eat straight away or chill in the fridge to reheat. This also freezes beautifully. Serve with crusty bread, if you like.", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-1239495_8-43e8a82.jpg", "nutrients": {"calories": "133 calories", "fatContent": "4 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "1 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "11 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "9 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "7 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.6 milligram of sodium"}}
