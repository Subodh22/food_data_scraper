Cut each half into six, so you have 12 squares. Working with one square at a time, fold in half diagonally to create a triangle. Lay the triangle out with the folded edge facing you. Cut a \u00bdcm border along the other two edges, stopping just before the two cuts intersect. Carefully unfold the pastry, then brush the borders with a little beaten egg. Lift the far left corner of the pastry and fold it over to the right, pressing it down gently against the inner right corner to seal. Repeat from the far right corner of the pastry to the inner left corner. Arrange the pastries over two baking trays lined with baking parchment, and spoon 1 tsp mincemeat into the middle of each. Top each with a few flaked almonds. Will keep chilled for up to 24 hrs.\nHeat the oven to 210C/190C fan/gas 6\u00bd. Brush the pastry with more egg and bake for 15-20 mins until puffed up and golden. Dust with icing sugar and enjoy warm, or leave to cool completely. Once cooled, will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for two days.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/11/Almond-mince-pies-2297e48.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "155 calories", "fatContent": "9 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "8 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "3 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.2 milligram of sodium"}}
