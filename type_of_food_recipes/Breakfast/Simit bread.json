Add the yeast and 150ml warm water, mix, then knead for a few mins to bring everything together into a soft dough. Tip onto your work surface and continue kneading for 10-12 mins until the dough feels stretchy. Return to a clean bowl, cover and leave to rise for an hour or two until doubled in size.\nMeanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan until golden. Set aside in the pan. Mix the molasses syrup or pomegranate molasses with 50ml water in a wide shallow bowl.\nDivide the dough into four equal pieces. Roll each into a sausage about 45cm long. Flip the rope of dough back on itself then twist the two strands and loop into a ring, squeezing the ends together to secure. Once shaped, dip each piece into the molasses water, turning to coat, then into the sesame seeds, making sure each one is well covered. Transfer to a baking tray, cover and leave to prove for another 45 mins-1 hr. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.\nWhen the breads have puffed up, uncover them and bake for 15-18 mins until golden. Cool, then wrap in a tea towel to keep them fresh. Can be made up to a day ahead and warmed gently before serving.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/simit-bread-d198642.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "408 calories", "fatContent": "15 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "52 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "4 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "5 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "14 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.2 milligram of sodium"}}
