By having the eggs at room temperature, it will be less of a shock for the egg reaching the hot water and therefore less likely to crack. You can also use an egg pricker to make a very small hole in each egg before boiling, which will also reduce the chances of it cracking in the heat. Slowly lower the eggs into the water using a spoon.\nSet your timer for 4-5 mins for runny/dippy eggs to serve with soldiers, or 6-7 mins for soft-boiled eggs for a salad. If serving in a salad, plunge the eggs into a bowl of cold water as soon as the timer goes off \u2013 this will stop them cooking and cool the shells quickly for peeling.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/eggsoldiers-f0e097c.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "191 calories", "fatContent": "13 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams saturated fat", "proteinContent": "19 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.5 milligram of sodium"}}
