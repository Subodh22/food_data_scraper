Bring to the boil, then boil for 5 minutes, drain and add fresh cold water to cover.\nRepeat this process until you're happy with the saltiness when tasted; we recommend to boil the fish three times in total for a perfect balance of salt in the fish. Drain and leave to cool. Use a fork to shred the salted cod into pieces and set aside.\nNow you'll need a large frying pan. Pour the vegetable oil into the frying pan and place over a high heat. Once the oil is sizzling hot, turn the heat down to low-medium. Add the onion, garlic, spring onions and scotch bonnet, then cook until soft, for around 5-7 minutes.\nAdd the salted cod, dash in some black pepper, thyme and pimento, then mix it together and cook down for around 3 minutes.\nNext, add in the red and green bell peppers, along with your tomato. Mix together and cook down for 2-3 minutes. These ingredients help to bring a heat balance, so it's not too spicy.\nNow you'll need to add in your ackee and dash in a little more black pepper. Fold in the ackee; the ackee is soft so it's important to fold it in very gently \u2013 nobody likes mushy ackee.\nOnce folded in, simmer for 3-5 minutes before serving.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/02/ackee-and-saltfish-c218a7b.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "435 calories", "fatContent": "22 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "1 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "4 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "53 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "2.19 milligram of sodium"}}
