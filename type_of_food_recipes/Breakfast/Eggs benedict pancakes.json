Pour 2 tbsp of the mixture into the pan and use the back of the spoon to shape it into a 8-9cm round disc. Depending on the size of your pan, you may be able to get 2 or 3 pancakes to cook at the same time. Cook for 2-3 mins on the first side, then flip over and cook for another 1 min.\nHeat oven to its lowest setting. Stack up the cooked pancakes on a baking tray and keep them warm in the oven while you cook the rest. Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Crack each egg into a ramekin, then carefully lower into the water. Poach for 2-3 mins until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny. Drain and repeat with the other eggs. Warm the hollandaise following pack instructions.\nTo serve, stack the pancakes with a layer of hollandaise, the ham and spinach leaves in between them, then top with a poached egg. Spoon over more hollandaise and top with chives and black pepper.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/eggs-benedict-pancakes-bebe955.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "605 calories", "fatContent": "36 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "5 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "23 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "2.14 milligram of sodium"}}
