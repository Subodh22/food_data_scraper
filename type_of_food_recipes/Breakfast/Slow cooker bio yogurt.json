Take a mugful of the warm milk and mix it with the yogurt then pour the mixture back into the slow cooker and stir really well. Cover, wrap the slow cooker in a big towel and then leave undisturbed for 9-12 hours until the mixture has set.\nEat on top of cereal or porridge, topped with fresh fruit, in marinades or drink in smoothies. If you want it thicker, for dips for example, line a large sieve with muslin and place it over a bowl, tip in the yogurt and allow some of the whey to strain off until you get the consistency of yogurt that you like. The longer you leave it, the thicker it will become.
