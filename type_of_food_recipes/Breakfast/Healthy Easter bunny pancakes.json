Add the egg yolks and a little of the milk, whisking to a thick paste. Add the remaining milk, a splash at a time, to loosen the batter. (Use whole or semi-skimmed milk if cooking for under fives, dependent on age.)\nIn a separate bowl and using a clean whisk, whisk the egg whites until they hold stiff peaks. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter with a spatula, trying to keep in as much air as possible.\nHeat a large non-stick pan over a medium heat and carefully wipe it with some oiled kitchen paper. Using a large spoon, add a generous dollop of batter to the pan in a round, for the bunny body. Add a smaller round for the head, two small ovals for feet, and two long thin strips for ears. Fit all the bunny components into the pan, or cook them in batches.\nFlip the pancakes after a minute or two, once the edges are set, the base is golden brown and bubbles start to pop on the surface. Cook for another min until golden brown.\nPut the bunny body in the middle of the plate, position the head, ears and feet just overlapping to look like the back of a bunny. Add a banana slice for the tail, and raisins (if using) for the feet pads.\nRepeat with the remaining batter. Decorate with extra chopped fruit, if you like.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/bunny_pancake-9f4bb7a.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "107 calories", "fatContent": "3 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "1 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "2 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "5 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.16 milligram of sodium"}}
