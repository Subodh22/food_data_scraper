Line a large baking sheet with baking parchment to prevent the granola from sticking. Put all of the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Whisk together the almond extract, vegetable oil and maple syrup in a jug, then pour into the bowl with the dry ingredients.\nMix together well, making sure that all the dry ingredients are well coated and that there are no dry bits. Tip the mixture onto the lined baking sheet and spread out in an even layer. Cook for about 25-30 mins until golden. You will need to give the mixture a few turns every 8-10 mins to make sure it dries out evenly and doesn\u2019t clump together too much. Keep an eye on it as nuts can burn easily.\nRemove from the oven and leave to cool completely on the tray. Break up any large clumps of granola with a wooden spoon. Will keep for up to one month in an airtight container. Serve with milk or yogurt, and fresh seasonal fruit, if you like.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/08/Nuts-and-seeds-granola-abee2ea.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "277 calories", "fatContent": "18 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "10 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "6 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.1 milligram of sodium"}}
