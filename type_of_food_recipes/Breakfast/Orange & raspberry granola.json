Line a sieve with clean muslin and pour in the oat mixture.

Best chilled at least 1 hr before serving. Can be kept in a sealed or covered jug in the fridge for up to 3 days.\nHeat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. Put the orange juice in a medium saucepan and bring to the boil. Boil rapidly for 5 mins or until the liquid has reduced by half, stirring occasionally. Mix the remaining 200g oats with the orange zest and cinnamon. Remove the pan from the heat and stir the oat mixture into the juice. Spread over the lined tray in a thin layer and bake for 10-15 mins or until lightly browned and crisp, turning the oats every few mins. Leave to cool on the tray.\nOnce cool, mix the oats with the raspberries, flaked almonds and seeds. Can be kept in a sealed jar for up to one week. To serve, spoon the granola into bowls, pour over the oat milk and top with the orange segments and mint leaves, if you like.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/orange-raspberry-granola-fa41fa0.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "363 calories", "fatContent": "11 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "1 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "12 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "10 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "15 grams protein"}}
