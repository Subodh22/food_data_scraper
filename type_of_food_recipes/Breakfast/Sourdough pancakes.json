Pour or ladle the batter into the pan, making 7-8cm pancakes, with plenty of space between them (you should fit three pancakes in at a time). The batter should sizzle a little as it hits the pan, but not aggressively \u2013 adjust the heat if you need to. Cook until bubbles start to form on the surface, then flip and cook the other side \u2013 they should take roughly 2 mins on each side. Eat straight away or keep warm in a low oven while you cook another batch.
