Turn a six-hole muffin tin upside down and lightly coat the bottom with cooking spray.

Remove the tins from the oven and leave to cool completely before taking the top tin off. Carefully peel the bacon cups away from the tin and drain upside down on a piece of kitchen paper until you need them.\nYou\u2019ve just cooked a delicious bowl.
