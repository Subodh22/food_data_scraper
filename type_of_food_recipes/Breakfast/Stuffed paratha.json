Leave to rest for 15 mins. Meanwhile, make your potato filling by mixing all the ingredients together with 1\u00bd tsp salt in a bowl. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions and do the same with the filling.\nTake a ball of dough, make an indent in the centre with your thumb and keep pressing and rotating the dough in your hand to make the cavity slightly larger than the size of a ball of the filling. The edge around the cavity of dough should be slightly thinner than the rest of it. Sit the ball of stuffing in the cavity and bring the dough together around the filling to cover it. Do not leave any cracks or the stuffing will spill out when you roll the parathas.\nLightly dust the parathas with flour, gently flatten, then roll out into a circle, roughly 20cm in diameter.\nHeat a heavy-based frying pan over a medium-low heat and add a rolled-out paratha. Cook dry for about 2-3 mins on one side, then flip over and cook the other side for another 2-3 minutes. When both sides become dry and start to colour, brush with a little ghee to get an even colouring and transfer to a foil-lined plate. While this first paratha is cooking, prepare the next one, and so on. Keep the pile of parathas warm by loosely wrapping in foil.\nMix the Greek yogurt with 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp sugar, the crushed cumin seeds and a splash of water to loosen slightly. Serve with the parathas, alongside an Indian pickle of your choice. Or, simply enjoy with cold salted butter.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/04/Paratha-fd9ab64.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "461 calories", "fatContent": "10 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "78 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "3 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "5 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "11 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "2.07 milligram of sodium"}}
