Add the baking powder, caster sugar, \u00bd tsp cinnamon and a generous pinch of salt. Whisk to combine. Crack in the eggs, add \u00bd the butter and all the milk, then whisk to a smooth batter. Will keep in the fridge overnight.\nStir the rest of the cinnamon, the light brown sugar and the maple syrup into the remaining melted butter. Add 3 tbsp of the pancake mixture and mix. Transfer to a squeezy bottle fitted with a small nozzle or a piping bag.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to cook, pour a little oil in your largest frying pan, and wipe out any excess with some kitchen paper. Keeping the pan over a low-medium heat, spoon 2-3 tbsp mounds into the pan for each pancake, leaving space for them to expand as they cook. You should get three or four in at a time. Use the cinnamon mixture in your bottle or piping bag to pipe swirls on top of each pancake. When the pancakes start to set around the edges and you see bubbles appear on top, carefully flip and cook for another 2-3 mins until golden and cooked through. Keep warm in a low oven while you continue cooking the rest of the batter.\nServe the pancakes with yogurt and extra maple syrup, if you like.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/cinnamon-roll-pancakes-8e22166.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "153 calories", "fatContent": "6 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "10 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "3 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.4 milligram of sodium"}}
