In a separate bowl, whisk together 50g of the garlic & herb soft cheese alternative with the milk until combined. Stir in half the chives, then pour into the dry ingredients, whisking to form a smooth, thick batter.\nHeat the grill to medium high. Arrange the tomato halves, cut-side up, and the mushrooms on a tray. Season well, scatter over the thyme leaves and drizzle over 1 tbsp oil, rubbing the oil into the mushrooms. Grill for 10-15 mins until softened and the mushrooms are wilted and tender throughout.\nMeanwhile, brush or swirl a little oil around a large non-stick frying pan and place over a medium heat. Add 2 tbsp of the batter to the pan to make small, round pancakes. Make sure they don't touch \u2013 you may need to do this in batches. Cook for 2 mins until the edges start to set and bubbles rise to the surface. Flip and cook for another 2-3 mins until light golden and cooked through. Keep the pancakes warm (underneath the tomatoes and mushrooms in the grill, or in a low oven) while you cook the remaining batter. Add a little more oil to the pan if needed. There should be 8-10 small pancakes in total.\nSpread the remaining soft cheese alternative over the pancakes, and divide between two warmed plates. Top each with a tomato half and the mushrooms. Season and scatter over the remaining chives to serve.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/12/savoury-vegan-pancakes-2190657.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "564 calories", "fatContent": "23 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "10 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "8 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "14 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.9 milligram of sodium"}}
