Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface into a circle the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Line a deep 20cm tart tin with the pastry, leaving about 2cm hanging over the edge. Prick the base with a fork, then chill for 30 mins.\nTo make the rice pudding, put the milk, cream, lemon zest and sugar into a pan. Bring to the boil, then pour in the rice and stir. Simmer, covered, over a low heat for 15 mins, then uncover and cook, stirring, for 25-30 mins until the rice is cooked but retains some bite. Remove from the heat and stir in half the lemon curd and mascarpone, then leave to cool slightly.\nMeanwhile, cover the pastry with a slightly scrunched sheet of baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Put on a baking sheet and bake for 15 mins. Remove the parchment and beans and bake for 15-20 mins more until golden. Leave to cool, then trim the edges with a serrated knife and set aside.\nWhisk the jam until smooth and spoon into the base of the pastry case, spreading it out. Stir the eggs into the rice pudding and tip into the case. Bake for 20 mins until just golden and set with a slight wobble. Leave to cool completely.\nMeanwhile, make the compote. Combine the blueberries, 1 tbsp water and the jam and microwave for 1-2 mins, stirring occasionally, until syrupy. The blueberries should be soft but still holding their shape.\nRemove the tart from the tin, put the rest of the curd in a piping bag and pipe over the top, then drizzle over most of the compote. Serve with any extra compote on the side.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/rice-pudding-tart-a132cc3.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "636 calories", "fatContent": "38 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "63 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "30 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "9 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.5 milligram of sodium"}}
