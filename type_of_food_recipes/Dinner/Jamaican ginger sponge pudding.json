Heat 4cm water in a heavy-based pan and add a trivet or upturned bowl or saucer to the base.\nSieve the flour, baking powder and bicarb into a large bowl. Add the breadcrumbs, ginger, allspice, cinnamon and \u00bd tsp fine salt and stir everything together. Wrap the end of the frozen butter in foil and, holding it by the foil end, coarsely grate the butter into the dry ingredients. Unwrap and discard the foil to grate the last piece. Fold everything together so the butter is evenly distributed. Mix in the stem ginger, eggs, treacle, sugar and milk. Spoon into the pudding basin, leaving a small gap for the sponge to rise, and cover with a disc of parchment. Seal the pudding basin with a tight-fitting lid or a double layer of foil, sealed tightly around the basin and tied with cook\u2019s string. Set on top of the trivet, cover with a lid and steam for 3 hrs, topping up with water so it doesn\u2019t boil dry.\nPour the syrup into a shallow frying pan, bring to the boil and cook until the syrup is turning a deep golden brown. Quickly whisk in the rum and butter, then whisk in the cream and bubble for 2 mins. Gently tip the sponge pudding out of its basin and onto a serving plate. Pour over the rum sauce and serve with thick cream or vanilla ice cream, if you like.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/jamaican-ginger-sponge-pudding-e270577.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "618 calories", "fatContent": "29 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "77 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "58 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "6 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.2 milligram of sodium"}}
