Mix the pork and beef mince with the fennel seeds, chilli, 1 tsp oregano and some seasoning in a large bowl until combined. Divide and shape into 18 meatballs with a nugget or two of taleggio in the middle (save some for the top), then chill for 10 mins.\nHeat 1 tbsp oil in a large pan (use a flameproof casserole dish if you can \u2013 it\u2019ll save on washing up). Add the onion and a pinch of salt and sizzle until softened (about 8 mins). Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 min more, then add the tomato pur\u00e9e, wine, tomatoes, passata, bay leaves, sugar, the remaining oregano and lots of seasoning, then cover with a lid and simmer for 20 mins. Meanwhile, arrange the meatballs on a baking tray lined with foil, drizzle with the remaining oil and bake for 10 mins.\nCook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to packet instructions, then drain, reserving some water. If the pan isn't ovenproof, tip the sauce into a casserole dish. Stir the pasta into the sauce, along with the liquid from the meatballs and some pasta water if it needs thinning. Turn the grill to a medium-high setting.\nNestle the meatballs into the pasta, so that they poke out the top. Scatter the remaining taleggio over the top and grill for 5-10 mins until the cheese and meatballs are golden. Serve with crusty bread, if you like.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/melting-meatball-macaroni-2173fc4.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "646 calories", "fatContent": "24 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "9 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "5 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "36 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.8 milligram of sodium"}}
