Whisk the whites until stiff. Add the sugar to the yolks and whisk again (no need to clean first) until thick and foamy \u2013 this will take about 5 mins. Whisk the mascarpone and cream liqueur into the egg yolks until you can\u2019t see any streaks of cheese. Carefully fold the whites into the mascarpone mixture with a large metal spoon to keep in as much air as possible.\nGet your serving dish ready (ours was 20 x 15 cm). Pour the coffee into a shallow dish and dip in a few sponge fingers at a time, turning them for a few seconds until they are nicely soaked, but not soggy. Layer these into the dish until you have used half the biscuits, then evenly spread over half of the creamy mixture. Using the coarse side of the grater, grate over most of the chocolate, then repeat the sponge and cream layers (you should use up all the coffee). If you want a pretty finish, you can pipe on the final cream layer.\nCover and chill for a few hours or overnight. This can now be kept in the fridge for up to two days. To serve, dust with cocoa powder and grate over the remaining chocolate.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/irish-cream-tiramisu-9ab7395.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "501 calories", "fatContent": "34 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "29 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "9 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.3 milligram of sodium"}}
