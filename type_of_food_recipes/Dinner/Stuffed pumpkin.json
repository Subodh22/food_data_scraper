Cut the top off the pumpkin or squash and use a metal spoon to scoop out the seeds. Get rid of any pithy bits but keep the seeds for another time (see our pumpkin seed recipe ideas). Put the pumpkin on a baking tray, rub with 2 tbsp of the oil inside and out, and season well. Roast in the centre of the oven for 45 mins or until tender, with the \u2018lid\u2019 on the side.\nMeanwhile, rinse the wild rice well and cook following pack instructions, then spread out on a baking tray to cool. Thinly slice the fennel bulb and apple, then squeeze over \u00bd the lemon juice to stop them discolouring.\nHeat the remaining 2 tbsp oil in a frying pan. Fry the fennel seeds and chilli flakes, then, once the seeds begin to pop, stir in \u00bd the garlic and the fennel. Cook for 5 mins until softened, then mix through the apple, pecans and lemon zest. Remove from the heat. Add the mixture to the the cooked rice, then stir in the chopped parsley and taste for seasoning.\nPack the mixture into the cooked pumpkin and return to the oven for 10-15 mins until everything is piping hot. Meanwhile, whisk the remaining lemon juice with the tahini, the rest of the garlic and enough water to make a dressing. Serve the pumpkin in the middle of the table, topped with pomegranate seeds and the dressing.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/pumpkin-57f52fa.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "693 calories", "fatContent": "21 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "97 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "10 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "9 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "20 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.3 milligram of sodium"}}
