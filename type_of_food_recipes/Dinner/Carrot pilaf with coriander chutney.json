Add the rice, stir briefly, then add the stock, a handful of the coriander, a good pinch of salt and grinding of black pepper.

Blend until smooth, adding another 2-3 tbsp water, if needed, to make a spoonable sauce.\nWhen all the liquid has been absorbed into the pilaf and the rice is tender, fluff up the grains with a fork.
