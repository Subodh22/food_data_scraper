Season well with the salt, then pour over the buttermilk and give it all a good mix. Cover and chill overnight.\nCombine the rice flour, cornflour, baking powder, paprika, garlic granules, dried oregano, 1 tsp salt and \u00bd tsp freshly ground black pepper in a medium bowl. Drop in the brined chicken pieces, four at a time, tossing lightly to coat well. Gently shake off any excess, then arrange on a baking tray.\nHeat the oil in a large, deep saucepan (ensuring it is no more than two-thirds full) to 170C or until a cube of bread dropped in browns within 30 seconds. Fry the chicken in small batches for 3 mins at a time until golden and cooked through. This will help keep the oil at the right temperature and won\u2019t overcrowd the pan.\nRemove the fried chicken pieces to a clean tea towel using tongs to drain off any excess oil, then transfer to a wire rack to ensure they stay crisp. Alternatively, put the fried chicken on a clean baking tray and keep warm and crisp in a low oven. When all the chicken pieces have been fried, drop the oregano leaves into the hot oil and fry until crisp, about 30 seconds- 1 min. Arrange the chicken on a serving platter, scatter over the fried oregano and serve with the pineapple sauce (see 'goes well with', below).", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/07/Fried-chicken-with-pineapple-hot-sauce-69a6a8d.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "647 calories", "fatContent": "19 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "82 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "19 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "34 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "5.3 milligram of sodium"}}
