The length of the ribs will be determined by the size of your roasting tin and barbecue \u2013 leave them whole or cut in half or thirds. Tip the ribs into a large, deep roasting tin. Whisk the rest of the ingredients together in a bowl until completely combined, then pour this over the ribs. Toss the ribs in the sauce using your hands to ensure they\u2019re completely coated. Cover the tin with foil, shiny-side down. To cook straightaway, simply leave to marinate while the oven heats up, or chill the ribs overnight.\nHeat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3 and bake the ribs for 2 hrs 30 mins-3 hrs, turning once or twice until the bones are exposed and the meat is pull-apart tender. When the ribs are cooked, leave to cool a little, then lift onto a tray using tongs. Pour the sauce from the tin into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 25-30 mins, stirring occasionally until thickened. Leave to cool. The sauce and ribs can be prepared up to two days ahead and chilled.\nLight the barbecue and wait until the coals are ashen, or set a gas barbecue to medium. Put as many ribs on the grill as you can fit, then brush generously with the sauce. Working quickly, grill the ribs, basting with more sauce and turning every minute or so until the ribs are well-coated, charred at the edges, caramelised and sticky. Repeat with any remaining ribs and sauce if they didn\u2019t all fit on the grill at once. Serve piled high on a platter with the reserved sauce on the side for slathering on top. Any leftover sauce will keep chilled in the fridge for up to a week.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/06/Fall-off-the-bone-sticky-barbecue-ribs-d488b38.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "363 calories", "fatContent": "18 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "32 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "17 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "2.7 milligram of sodium"}}
