Put the butter and flour in a food processor with 1/4 tsp salt and blend until the mixture resembles damp breadcrumbs. Or do this by rubbing the butter and flour together in a big bowl with your fingertips. Add the sugar and briefly whizz again or stir to combine.\nWhisk the egg yolk with 2 tbsp cold water, and drizzle over the flour mixture. Use the pulse button to blend the mixture once more, keep going until it starts to form larger clumps. If the mixture seems too dry, add a little more water a tsp or 2 at a time, but no more than 3 tsp in total.\nTip out onto a work surface and briefly knead the dough to bring it together into a smooth ball. Avoid overworking or it will become tough. Flatten the dough into a puck shape and wrap well in cling film. Chill for at least 30 mins, or for up to 2 days, or freeze for 2 months.\nNext, make the filling. Put the figs, raspberries, sugar and cornflour in a large bowl and gently toss together, being careful not to break up the raspberries, until the fruit is well coated. Put the cardamom in a mortar and crack the pods with a pestle. Remove the seeds from their pods and place them back in the mortar, discarding the pods. Crush the seeds then add to the fruit, along with the rosewater. Set aside for 15 mins.\nRemove the dough from the fridge and divide into 2 pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Re-wrap the smaller piece and set aside. Divide the larger piece of dough into the number of pies you\u2019d like to make, or leave whole for a large one. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to the thickness of a 50p piece, or until large enough to line the base of your pie plate or tin, with a little pastry overhanging. Roll the dough over your rolling pin, lift into your plate or tins, and press it well into the corners. Scatter the polenta or almonds over and spoon in the filling. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and place a baking sheet on the middle shelf.\nTo create a stamped design for the top of the pie, roll out the pastry on a well-floured sheet of baking parchment . Use a small biscuit cutter to stamp out shapes (we\u2019ve used a heart cutter, but circles, diamonds or flower shapes look pretty too). Brush the pie edge with egg, then slide the pastry lid on top. Trim the edge with scissors and squeeze the pastry edge around the top of your index finger, using your thumb and the other index finger. Work your way along the pastry edge to give a professionally fluted finish. Once covered, whisk the reserved egg white and brush over the pastry. Scatter with a little extra sugar, then place the pie on the baking sheet and bake for 45 mins for a large pie, 35-40 mins for medium pies or 25-30 mins for mini pies, until the pastry is golden and crisp and the juices are bubbling. Cool for 10 mins before serving with cream, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, natural yogurt or soured cream.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/fig-raspberry-cardamom-pie-cut-into-ea0e0a9.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "523 calories", "fatContent": "25 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "63 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "30 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "6 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "7 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.2 milligram of sodium"}}
