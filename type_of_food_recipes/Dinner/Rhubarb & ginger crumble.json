First, make the topping. In a bowl, rub the flour and butter together with your fingertips until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add in the oats and sugar, and stir with a wooden spoon to form a coarse crumble.\nSpread out the crumble in an even layer on a baking tray and bake in the centre of the oven for 15 mins until golden, with larger clusters of crumble formed. Once the mixture has cooled slightly, stir through the nuts.\nNext, make the crumble filling. Melt the butter in a heavy-based saucepan, then add the sugar and vanilla, and give everything a good stir. Tip in the apple and cook for 5 mins, stirring constantly, until the apples have turned into a thick pur\u00e9e. Once the apples have broken down, add the rhubarb and ginger. Stir well, then simmer for 5 mins until the rhubarb has just begun to soften. Pour the filling into a bowl and leave to cool.\nOnce ready to eat, divide the crumble filling into six individual pie dishes, or one larger dish if you prefer, then top with the crumble topping. Can be assembled a day ahead and kept in the fridge, or frozen. To reheat from frozen, cook for an extra 15 mins until piping hot throughout. Bake in the centre of the oven for 15 mins, until bubbling throughout. Serve with the clotted cream.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/rhubarb-ginger-crumble-73031a0.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "705 calories", "fatContent": "33 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "87 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "53 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "8 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "10 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.5 milligram of sodium"}}
