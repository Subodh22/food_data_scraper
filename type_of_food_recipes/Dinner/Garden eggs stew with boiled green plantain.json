Cook for 10-12 mins, then drain and set aside.\nMeanwhile, put the chopped onion in an asanka pot and grind to a paste. If you don\u2019t have an asanka pot, you can use a food processor or blender \u2013 if using a blender, drain away any water after blending.\nDrain the water from the tilapia, then rinse the fish under cold running water to remove any excess salt.\nIn a separate pan over a medium-high heat, bring the green plantains, eggs and just enough water to cover to the boil. Once boiling, add the tilapia. Cook for 10-12 mins, then remove from the heat. Take the fish out of the pan using a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate. Leave to rest. Drain the plantains and eggs, then fill the pan with cold water and leave to stand for 5 mins.\nMeanwhile, put the chillies in the asanka pot or food processor with the onion, and grind. When the mixture is smooth, add a 2-3 aubergines and grind again. Continue this process until all the aubergines have been added. Add the peanut butter, then season with half the shrimp cube, if using, and the aromat, if needed (taste for seasoning before adding the aromat).\nRinse the fermented salted fish under cold running water. Heat the red palm fruit & rapeseed oil in a frying pan set over a medium heat, and fry the fermented salted fish for around 3-5 mins. Remove the fish from the pan using a slotted spoon or fish slice, and remove any visible bones. Add the fish to the asanka pot and grind into the aubergine mixture. Discard any fish bones.\nAdd the sliced onions to the frying pan and fry for 3-5 mins, then add the aubergine mixture and stir well. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 3-5 mins. Mix in the sardines. Cook over the lowest heat for around 2 mins more, and mix everything together well.\nTransfer the mixture to an asanka pot or serving bowl. Drain the plantains and peel and halve the boiled eggs, then add these to the pot. Top with the avocado and tilapia, then serve.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/10/Garden-egg-stew-a6cbbce.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "620 calories", "fatContent": "33 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "21 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "7 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "38 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.13 milligram of sodium"}}
