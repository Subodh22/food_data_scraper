Season the meat.\nWhen your guests are ready to eat, fill your fondue pan half-full of vegetable oil and heat on the hob until it\u2019s hot, but not smoking. You\u2019re aiming for around 190C, but if you haven\u2019t got a thermometer, throw in a cube of bread \u2013 when it takes about 30 secs to brown, it\u2019s ready.\nPut the fondue burner on the table carefully so that it\u2019s stable, then, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, light the flame and put the pan on top.\nGive each guest a fondue fork for dunking the meat in the hot oil. It should take 25-30 secs for rare, 30-35 secs for medium and 45-60 secs for well done. When the meat is cooked, dip it into the sauces, and pile it onto the bread. If you have some raw king prawns to cook in the fondue, they work really well too. CORRECTION NOTICE Please be informed that in the July issue of BBC Good Food Magazine, it incorrectly stated that the temperature of the oil in this recipe should be 375C, the correct temperature of the oil should be 375 Fahrenheit or 190C.
