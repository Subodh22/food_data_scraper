When all the meat is browned, pour a little wine into the now-empty frying pan and bubble to release any caramelised bits from the pan.\nHeat 1 tbsp oil in a large casserole and fry 3 large or 6 normal carrots, cut into large chunks, and 2 roughly chopped onions until they start to colour. Stir in 3 tbsp plain flour for 1 min, then add 1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e.\nAdd the beef and any juices, the wine from the frying pan and the rest of the wine and herbs. Season and bring to a simmer. Give everything a good stir, then cover.\nTransfer to the oven and bake for 2 hrs until the meat is really tender. Cool. Will freeze for up to 3 months.\nTo serve, defrost completely overnight in the fridge if frozen, then place on a low heat to warm through.\nMeanwhile, heat a small knob of butter in a frying pan and add 300g bacon lardons and 500g peeled pearl onions or small shallots. Sizzle for about 10 mins until the bacon starts to crisp and the onions soften and colour.\nAdd 400g halved mushrooms and fry for another 5 mins, then stir everything into the stew and heat for 10 mins more.
