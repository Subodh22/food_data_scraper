Simmer to a sauce consistency, then stir in the cream, mustard and cheese, followed by the turkey or chicken, ham and sprouts. Take off the heat and season well.\nTip the pie filling into a baking dish. Unroll the shortcrust pastry and, if you need to, roll a little thinner until it\u2019s big enough to cover the pie dish. Divide the pastry into 6 portions by pricking lines with the prongs of a fork. These pricked lines will also work as air holes for the steam to escape, so you don\u2019t need to use a pie funnel. Lift the pastry onto the pie dish. Crimp or pinch the edges to seal the pastry to the dish, and glaze the top with a little milk or egg. Scatter with the extra cheese and bake for 30-40 mins until golden and crisp.\nLeave the pie to cool for 5-10 mins, then serve with mash and greens, if you like.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/ham-turkey-sprout-pie-0d10d95.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "662 calories", "fatContent": "38 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "4 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "43 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "2.6 milligram of sodium"}}
