Using a free-standing mixer fitted with a beater attachment (or an electric hand whisk and large bowl), mix the butter and sugar until smooth and pale. Reduce the speed, slowly add the flour, then just before it\u2019s fully combined, add the egg yolk and mix briefly until smooth (if the pastry is dry add 1 tsp cold water). Remove the pastry from the bowl, wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge overnight, or for at least 1 hr.\nFor the frangipane, cream the butter and icing sugar in a freestanding mixer or with an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy. Mix in the eggs one at a time, then fold in the almonds and calvados and beat for 3 mins more. Chill until needed.\nHeat oven to 170C/150C fan/gas 3. Roll out the pastry on a well-floured surface to the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Gently press the pastry into either a 23cm tart ring on a baking sheet or a 23cm fluted tart tin (the pastry may crack \u2013 patch up any holes with leftover pastry). Trim the edges neatly, then chill in the fridge for 20 mins.\nStand the tart tin (if using) on a baking sheet, then spoon in the frangipane and smooth with the back of the spoon, leaving a 0.5cm gap at the top. Peel and core the apples, then cut into 4mm slices using a mandolin or knife across the width of the apple so there\u2019s a hole in the middle of each slice. Arrange the apples on top of the frangipane. Sieve a good layer of icing sugar on top, then bake for 1 hr-1 hr 15 mins or until the apples are caramelised and the frangipane is cooked (use a skewer to check). Leave to cool for 30 mins before serving.\nNext make the Chantilly. Whip the double cream and icing sugar to soft peaks, then add the Calvados and vanilla seeds, and whisk again until the mixture holds its shape. Chill in the fridge until you are ready to serve with the tart.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/apple-and-almond-tart-ef10800.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "846 calories", "fatContent": "53 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "29 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "74 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "48 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "9 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.7 milligram of sodium"}}
