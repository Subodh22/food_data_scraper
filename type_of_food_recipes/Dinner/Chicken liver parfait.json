Meanwhile, heat half the oil in a large frying pan. Once hot, add half of the livers and sear them for 1 min on each side so they are brown on the outside but still rosy in the middle. Tip into a colander with a bowl underneath to catch any leftover fat. Repeat with the remaining livers and oil.\nTip the livers into a food processor along with the cooled red wine and shallot mix. Add half the thyme leaves, all the cream and melted butter. Blend to a fine pur\u00e9e and season generously, then pour into a jar, pot or six individual ramekins. Transfer to the fridge to set for 2 hrs.\nOnce the parfait has set, sprinkle with the remaining thyme leaves and spoon over a thin layer of melted clarified butter and put back in the fridge to set the butter. Can be made up to two days ahead and chilled. To serve, toast the brioche and serve with the parfait and a separate pot of chutney for everyone to help themselves.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/chicken-liver-parfait-c936f22.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "751 calories", "fatContent": "58 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "33 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "8 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "18 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.8 milligram of sodium"}}
