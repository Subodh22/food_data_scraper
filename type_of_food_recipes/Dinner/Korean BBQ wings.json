To make the sauce, pour the vinegar and soy into a jug. Heat the sugar and 1 tbsp water in a small pan until the sugar has dissolved, then simmer until it turns a deep caramel colour. Standing well back as it will spit, pour in the vinegar and soy. Reduce the heat and let it bubble for a few mins, then add the remaining sauce ingredients, stir well and cook for 5 mins until smooth and thickened. Set aside.\nLight the barbecue (or set your oven grill to medium). Once the coals have died down, spread out to an even layer. Cut the tips from the chicken wings, then stretch them out as straight as you can and push a skewer through the length of each wing. Brush the skin with the oil and season. Cook the wings on the barbecue or under the grill for 10 mins each side, until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is golden brown and crisp.\nRemove the skewers to a large plate. Pour two-thirds of the sauce into a bowl, reserving the rest in the pan. Using a brush, coat each skewer well with the sauce from the bowl, then return them to the barbecue or grill and cook for a further 2-3 mins each side until the sauce has caramelised.\nTransfer the skewers to a serving platter. Reheat the reserved sauce, adding a splash of water to loosen if needed, then drizzle over the skewers. Top with the sesame seeds and spring onions.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/korean_1-52c35c0.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "344 calories", "fatContent": "17 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "24 grams sugar", "proteinContent": "24 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.9 milligram of sodium"}}
