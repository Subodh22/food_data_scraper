Toss the lamb in the flour with some seasoning, then brown it in the dish. Do this in batches so you don\u2019t overcrowd the dish (which will cause the meat to steam instead of fry). Take your time to build up a deep brown colour, which will add lots of meaty flavour to the stew. Set the meat aside on a plate as you go.\nAdd the remaining oil to the dish along with the onion and garlic. Cook for 5 mins until softened, then stir in the spices, tomatoes, lemon zest and juice, honey and molasses. Fill the tomato can halfway with water, swill around and add this too. Season well, bring to a simmer and cover with a lid. Reduce the heat and cook for 2 hrs 30 mins-3 hrs or until the meat is tender. Leave to cool.\nHeat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Transfer the meat to a pie dish that\u2019s about 25cm wide, or leave it in the casserole if it\u2019s wide enough to fit the topping. Unwrap the filo and brush a sheet with butter, scrunch up and place on top of the pie. Continue with the remaining sheets until the tagine is covered. Drizzle any remaining butter over the top and scatter over the almonds, then bake for 45 mins or until the pastry is crisp and golden. Scatter over the pomegranate seeds just before serving.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/spiced-lamb-pie-68e5198.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "595 calories", "fatContent": "30 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "11 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "34 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.8 milligram of sodium"}}
