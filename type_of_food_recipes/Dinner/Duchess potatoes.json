Mix well with a spatula until the butter has melted and is well incorporated. It will come away from the sides of the bowl, similar to choux pastry.\nHeat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Spoon the mash into a piping bag with a wide star nozzle. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment and brush over a little vegetable oil. Pipe 20 walnut-sized peaked mounds onto the prepared tray, as if you were icing a cupcake. Beat the egg white with a pinch of salt and brush the potato mounds gently, to keep the fluting.\nBake the potatoes for 15-20 mins until golden-brown and crisp.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/11/duchess-potatoes-c14e25f.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "161 calories", "fatContent": "9 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "1 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "5 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.3 milligram of sodium"}}
