Cream the butter and sugar in a large bowl, using an electric whisk or a wooden spoon, until pale and light. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition, then add the vanilla seeds. Stir in the flour, then bring the dough together with your hands until it forms a ball that leaves the bowl clean. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 mins or overnight.\nHeat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and grease a 23cm loose-bottomed, deep fluted tart tin. Lightly dust your work surface with flour, then roll out the chilled pastry and line your tin with it, making sure there\u2019s a slight overhang. If the pastry tears, use your fingers to push the pieces back together (it will fuse back together neatly in the oven). Put a piece of baking parchment on top of the pastry and weigh it down with baking beans. Bake for 15 mins, remove the parchment and beans, and return to the oven for a further 15 mins until crisp and golden.\nTrim any excess pastry with a serrated knife, so the edge sits flush with the tin, and let cool completely.\nMix all the rose & cassis layer ingredients in a bowl, using enough food colouring to turn it dusky pink. Pour the mixture into the pastry case and chill for 10 mins to firm up.\nMeanwhile, for the cheesecake layer, break the chocolate into pieces and tip into a large, heatproof bowl. In a small pan, gently heat the double cream and cream cheese until piping hot and melted together. Quickly pour the mixture over the chocolate, let it sit for 1 min, then stir until completely smooth and melted. Pour the mixture over the rose & cassis layer, then return the tart to the fridge.\nTo make the chocolate ganache, put all the ganache ingredients in a heatproof bowl and microwave in short bursts until melted. (Alternatively, heat all the ingredients in a bowl over a pan of barely simmering water.) Pour over the cheesecake layer and chill the tart for at least 30 mins, or overnight if you prefer. Just before serving, carefully remove the tart from the tin and put on a serving plate or board. Decorate with a pinch of sea salt flakes and a few rose petals. Cut into slices and serve.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/death-by-chocolate-tart-a14fb5f.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "793 calories", "fatContent": "48 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "29 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "79 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "57 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "7 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.5 milligram of sodium"}}
