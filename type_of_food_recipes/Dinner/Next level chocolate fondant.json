Put them on a baking tray and transfer to the fridge to chill until the butter sets. Brush over another layer of the butter, then dust generously with the cocoa. Return to the fridge to set. Mix the caramel sauce with a good pinch of sea salt flakes, then chill in the fridge until ready to use.\nTip the remaining butter, the chocolate and coffee powder into a heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over a pan of gently simmering water, ensuring the bottom of the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the water. Stir the mixture until smooth, adding another small pinch of sea salt. Tip the whole eggs, egg yolks and sugar into another bowl and beat together using an electric whisk until very pale \u2013 the whisk should leave a trail in the mixture when lifted. Sift in the flour, then gently fold in the melted chocolate mixture.\nSpoon the fondant mixture into the prepared basins until just about halfway full, then transfer to the freezer on a baking tray for about 20-25 mins, or until the mixture is just set. Add 1 tsp of the salted caramel sauce to the middle of each fondant, then top up with the remaining fondant mixture. Return to the freezer until frozen. Can be prepared up to two weeks ahead.\nHeat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the fondants on a baking tray and bake for 15 mins until the tops have formed a crust and they are starting to come away from the sides of the basins. Remove from the oven, then leave to rest for 1 min before turning out onto warm plates. Sprinkle with extra sea salt, then serve straightaway.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/chocolate-fondant-d62c6c2.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "643 calories", "fatContent": "50 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "29 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "26 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "5 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "10 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.9 milligram of sodium"}}
