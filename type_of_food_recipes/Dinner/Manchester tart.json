Mix in the sugar and a pinch of salt, followed by the egg yolk, and bring it together into a dough. If the pastry is too dry to come together, add 1-2 tbsp cold water. Tip onto a work surface and form into a rough ball. Knead briefly.\nRoll the pastry out between two sheets of baking parchment into a roughly 28cm circle. Chill for 20-30 mins until firm, then use it to line a 23cm tart tin. Push the pastry into the corners, then trim the edge so there\u2019s 1-2cm pastry overhanging the rim (don\u2019t worry if it breaks slightly, as it can be patched with any off-cuts). Prick the pastry base several times with a fork, then chill for 45 mins. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.\nLine the chilled pastry case with a sheet of baking parchment, then fill to the top with baking beans, uncooked rice or lentils. Bake for 15 mins, then remove the beans and parchment and bake for 10-15 mins more until the pastry is golden brown. Leave to cool in the tin, then trim the excess pastry using a small serrated knife.\nMeanwhile, make the custard. Bring the milk and vanilla to the boil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Beat the egg yolks, caster sugar and custard powder together in a medium bowl until well combined.\nSlowly pour the hot milk mixture over the egg mixture, whisking continuously until everything is smooth and well combined. Tip the custard mixture back into the pan and cook over a medium-low heat, stirring continuously, for 2-3 mins until very thick. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly.\nSpread the jam over the base of the cooled pastry case. Carefully pour over the custard and smooth with the back of a spoon or spatula. Sprinkle over the coconut and dot the maraschino cherries around the edge in a circle. Chill for 2-3 hrs, or until set.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/01/Manchester-tart-59da211.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "342 calories", "fatContent": "15 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "29 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "6 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.1 milligram of sodium"}}
