Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. Season the duck and lay it skin-side down on one side of the pan, then add the potatoes on the other side of the pan. Cook for 10 mins, but lower the heat if the duck skin is browning too quickly \u2013 it should be golden along with one side of the potatoes. Remove the duck to a plate, then turn the potatoes. Add the cabbage wedges to the pan, then put in the oven for 10 mins or until the cabbage is slightly wilting.\nCarefully remove the pan from the oven. Turn the cabbage, then return the duck to the pan, skin-side up. Put back in the oven for 8 mins for pink meat, or 10 mins if you prefer the duck well done.\nRemove the cabbage and potatoes from the pan and keep warm in a low oven. Put the pan with the duck back on the hob over a high heat. Drizzle with the honey and pour over the citrus juice. Bubble the liquid down to a sticky glaze for about 2-3 mins so it coats the duck, then spoon the glaze over. Remove the duck to a plate. Pour the stock into the pan, bring back to the boil and leave to bubble for 3-4 mins to create a syrupy sauce, adding any juices from the plate. Carve the duck into thick slices and arrange on a warm plate with the potatoes and cabbage. Pour over the sauce.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/10/Orange-glazed-duck-with-duck-fat-fondant-potatoes-3bc4ace.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "574 calories", "fatContent": "20 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "13 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "8 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "44 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.6 milligram of sodium"}}
