Put the pork belly in a roasting tin and slash lines across the skin (about 5mm apart) using a sharp knife. Rub the skin with most of the salt mix, and chill, uncovered, overnight.\nThe next day, heat the oven to 170C/150C fan/gas 3. Remove the pork from the fridge and scrape off the salt mix. Pat well with kitchen paper to remove the moisture, then re-season with the remaining salt mix. Roast for 2 hrs, then reduce the oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 2 and cook for a further 1 hr. Turn the oven up to its highest for 15-20 mins or until crackled. If your pork still hasn\u2019t crackled enough, heat the grill to its highest setting. Transfer the pork to a baking sheet and grill for 4-5 mins (watch it to make sure it doesn\u2019t burn). Cover and rest for 30 mins.\nTo make the slaw, mix together the lemon zest and juice with the olive oil, chilli and some seasoning in a large bowl. Toss the with the shallot, fennel and apple. Top with the fennel fronds, if you like.\nWhizz together all the ingredients for the mojo verde and season to taste. Slice and serve the pork with the slaw and mojo verde on the side. Any leftover pork can be warmed and piled into crusty rolls with the slaw and mojo verde.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/05/Crispy-crackled-pork-belly-3542868.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "670 calories", "fatContent": "54 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "4 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "41 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "2.8 milligram of sodium"}}
