Blitz the digestives in a food processor until you get fine crumbs, or bash in a sandwich bag with a rolling pin. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the melted butter until it looks like damp sand. Tip into the prepared tin, and smooth the mixture with the back of a spoon to make an even base, then chill.\nSoak the gelatine leaves in cold water. Put the raspberries in a food processor or in a jug using a stick blender, and blitz to a smooth pur\u00e9e. Sieve out the seeds. Warm the raspberry sauce in a small pan with 1 tbsp sugar until just starting to steam, then pour over 1 drained gelatine leaf in a bowl and stir to dissolve.\nBlitz 3 (about 65g) of the strawberries in a food processor, and warm through with 1 tbsp sugar in the same way. Tip into a bowl and stir in the other drained gelatine leaf.\nWhisk the soft cheese, cream and caster sugar until it just starts to thicken. Divide between three bowls (about 260g per bowl). Fold the strawberry pur\u00e9e into one with a few drops of food colouring to make it light pink, the raspberry mix with the gelatine into another with more food colouring so it\u2019s dark pink, and the vanilla bean paste into the third.\nSpoon the raspberry filling over the biscuit base, smoothing the surface so it\u2019s flat. Next, add the strawberry filling, gently smoothing over without disturbing the bottom layer, then repeat with the vanilla mixture, using a clean spoon to level the top. A spatula or knife might help with this to keep from dragging the below layers. Chill for 4 hrs or overnight.\nRun a knife around the sides of the cake tin between the cheesecake and the parchment, and loosen the base. Transfer to a cake stand, and smooth the sides, using a palette knife, to neaten the layers. Mix the chocolate with a few drops of lemon extract, if using. Pile the remaining strawberries, some sliced, some whole, on top, and drizzle over the chocolate to finish.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/triple-layered-berry-cheesecake-878b1b4.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "400 calories", "fatContent": "32 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "14 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "4 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.6 milligram of sodium"}}
