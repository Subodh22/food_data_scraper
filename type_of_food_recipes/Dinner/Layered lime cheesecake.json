Tip in the double cream and continue beating until completely combined. Spoon the cream mixture onto the biscuit base, working from the edges inwards and making sure that there are no air bubbles. Smooth the top of the cheesecake down with the back of a dessert spoon. Leave to set in the fridge while you make the glaze.\nSoak the gelatine leaves in cold water. Tip the other ingredients for the glaze into a saucepan with 200ml water. Cook gently until the sugar has dissolved and the syrup is simmering. Drain and squeeze the gelatine of any excess water, then stir into the hot syrup to dissolve. Leave everything to infuse until just warm, then sieve the syrup into a jug. When cooled, pour over the cheesecake and put in the fridge overnight to set. Carefully remove the cake from tin before serving.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/keylime-cheesecake-b9a72ef.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "428 calories", "fatContent": "33 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "22 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "sodiumContent": "0.4 milligram of sodium"}}
