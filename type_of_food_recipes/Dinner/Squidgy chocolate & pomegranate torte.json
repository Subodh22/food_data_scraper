Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the butter and chocolate in a medium bowl and gently melt together, either over a pan of simmering water or in the microwave. Stir until smooth, then set aside.\nCrack the eggs into a large bowl, add the sugar, then whisk for 5-8 mins with electric hand beaters until thick, mousse-like and doubled in volume. Pour the chocolate mix around the edge of the bowl, then fold together using a large metal spoon until the batter is evenly brown with the odd ribbon of chocolate appearing. Don\u2019t rush this bit, it\u2019s important to preserve the bubbles you\u2019ve so carefully made. Sift over the almonds, flour and \u00bc tsp salt, then fold in until even. Slowly pour the batter into the tin, then use a spatula to get every last bit from the bowl. Bake on a middle shelf for 30-35 mins, or until the cake is risen and set on top. Cool the cake in its tin on a rack. The torte may sink and crack a little, which is fine.\nFor the topping, bring the cream to the boil. Put the chocolate in a bowl with the icing sugar, then tip the hot cream over it. Leave for a few mins, stir until smooth, then let it cool and thicken for 10 mins. Carefully remove the torte from its tin onto a plate, then spread the icing over the top, letting it drip down the sides. Leave to set for a few mins, then scatter with the pomegranate seeds and either chill for a few hours, or serve straight away.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/feburary-cake-db9e898.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "544 calories", "fatContent": "40 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "28 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "7 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.2 milligram of sodium"}}
