Leave to brown for a few mins more, then stir in the ginger, garlic, spices and tomato pur\u00e9e. Stir for a few mins until the mixture is sticky and aromatic. Add 600ml water, the stock cube and the sugar.\nBring to a simmer, then lower the heat and cook for 45 mins, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking. The sauce should be thick but if it reduces too quickly, add a splash of water or cover with a lid.\nPut the sweet potatoes and potatoes in a pan and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, cover with a lid and simmer for 15 mins until tender. Drain and leave to steam dry for 10 mins.\nMash the potatoes with the cheese and some seasoning. Tip the mince into a baking dish about 20 x 35cm and 10cm deep. Stir in the peas. Cover with the mash, making dips and peaks with the back of your spoon, or pipe the mash on for a neater finish. Crush the poppadums in your hands and scatter over the mash, then drizzle over a little oil. You can now chill for up to two days or freeze for two months. If cooking straightaway, heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.\nBake for 45 mins until golden and bubbling around the edges. Leave to cool for 5 mins, then serve with the green chilli scattered over, if you like.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/lamb-keema-shepherds-pie-f40c0b3.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "445 calories", "fatContent": "19 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "11 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "8 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "24 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.8 milligram of sodium"}}
