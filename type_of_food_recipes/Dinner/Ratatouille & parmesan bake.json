Cut the aubergine lengthways into long thin slices \u2013 once you have six slices, chop the remainder. Brush the slices very lightly with oil, place on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment and cook for 15 mins, turning once, until softened and pliable. Turn oven down to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.\nMeanwhile, heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan and fry the onions until softened. Stir in the chopped aubergine, the peppers, courgettes and garlic, and cook, stirring, for a few mins more. Tip in the tomatoes and a half a can of water, then stir in the bouillon, thyme and basil stalks. Cover and simmer for 20 mins or until tender. You can add up to half a can of water if the mixture is getting too dry. Stir through the basil leaves.\nIf you are following our Healthy Diet Plan, set aside half of the ratatouille when it is ready - you'll need to chill this for our ratatouille pasta salad with rocket later in the week. If you're not following the plan, you can serve the extra ratatouille on the side or set it aside to enjoy for another meal.\nBeat the eggs with the yogurt, cheese and 1 tbsp water. Spoon the remaining ratatouille into a shallow ovenproof dish, top with the aubergine slices, then cover with the yogurt mixture and scatter with thyme. Bake for 10-15 mins until the topping is set and starting to colour. Serve with dressed rocket on the side.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/ratatouille-parmesan-bake-5e302e3.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "310 calories", "fatContent": "11 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "25 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "16 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "17 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.5 milligram of sodium"}}
