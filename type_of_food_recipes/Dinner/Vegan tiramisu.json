First, make the sponge. Using a little dairy-free spread, butter and line a 20cm x 30cm tin (or 25cm square).\nPut the dairy-free milk in a jug and stir in the vinegar and extract, and leave for a few minutes to thicken. Beat the dairy-free spread and sugar together until creamy, then beat in the thickened milk mixture, flour, a pinch of salt and the baking powder until you have a smooth batter.\nScrape the batter into the tin and bake for 20-25 mins until lightly golden and risen, and a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the middle. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.\nWhip the plant cream with the icing sugar and vanilla bean paste until softly whipped. Mix the liqueur, coffee and caster sugar in a bowl. Cut the cooled sponge into 16-18 sponge fingers.\nAdd half the sponge fingers to a small serving dish (about 15 x 20cm), breaking them up to fill any gaps. Using a pastry brush, brush the sponge with some of the coffee mixture. It won\u2019t absorb as much as regular sponge fingers, so add gradually until they are lightly soaked. Spoon over half the cream mixture, then add the remaining sponge fingers. Brush again with the coffee mixture, then add the remaining cream and chill for a few hours or overnight. Sieve over the cocoa powder to serve.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/08/vegan-tiramisu-1dab5a8.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "534 calories", "fatContent": "29 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "57 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "31 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "6 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.72 milligram of sodium"}}
