Tip into a large bowl with the buttermilk and 1 tsp heaped salt, turning to coat. Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for 4 hrs or overnight.\nHeat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3 and line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Tip the tomatoes onto the baking sheet with the garlic and thyme. Drizzle over the olive oil, season and roast for 50 mins-1 hr, or until soft but holding their shape.\nFor the corn, heat the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat until foaming. Add the shallot, reduce the heat to low and fry for 10 mins until softened. Cut the kernels from the corn cobs and add these to the pan along with 125ml water. Simmer for 5 mins, then add the cream and simmer, uncovered, for 5 mins more. Remove from the heat, blitz the mixture to a rough texture with a hand blender, then stir through the cheese and season to taste. Set aside.\nRemove the chicken from the marinade, wiping away any excess using kitchen paper. Tip the beaten eggs into a shallow bowl, put the flour in a second and the panko in a third. Dip each marinated chicken breast into the flour, then the egg and lastly the panko. Heat the oil in a large skillet or non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat and fry the breaded chicken breasts for 5-6 mins on each side or until golden and cooked through (you may need to do this in batches). Gently reheat the creamed corn, then serve with the schnitzel and roast tomatoes.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/04/Chicken-schnitzel-cc1b206.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "849 calories", "fatContent": "42 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "58 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "14 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "9 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "56 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "2.5 milligram of sodium"}}
