(Otherwise, remember to turn the oven on 10 mins before baking.)\nIn the first dish, mix the parmesan, mayo, garlic, lemon zest, herbs and seasoning to form a paste \u2013 a tablespoon does this well, and helps at the next stage. Tip the crumbs into the second dish and shake so they cover the base.\nNow the messy part. Put the chicken on the board and, if necessary, trim and discard any flappy bits. Blot well with kitchen paper \u2013 this will help the coating stick.\nSlide the first breast into the mayo mix and use the spoon to make sure it is coated all over. Pick it up by the pointy end and place on the crumbs. Use a spoon to cover completely with crumbs, and press them on gently until covered all over. Pick up once again by the \u2018tail\u2019 and place on the prepared baking tray. Repeat with the second breast, then discard any leftover mayo and crumbs.\nBake for 25-30 mins until golden and cooked through. Transfer to a board and slice into three or four thick slices, scatter over the chives and serve with the lemon wedges, roasted potatoes and tomatoes, if you like.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/crunchy-garlic-chicken-60b790a.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "875 calories", "fatContent": "70 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "3 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "41 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.1 milligram of sodium"}}
