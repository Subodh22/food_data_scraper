To make the pur\u00e9e, blitz the raspberries to a pulp in a blender, then pass through a fine sieve into a saucepan. Gently reduce the pur\u00e9e on a low heat for 30 mins, stirring occasionally, until the colour has intensified and the pur\u00e9e has reduced to about 200ml. Remove from the heat and leave to cool.\nWhile the pur\u00e9e cools, put the egg yolks and sugar in a glass bowl and whisk over a pan of simmering water for 10 mins until the eggs are pale, thick and doubled in volume. Set aside.\nNext, put the sugar for the meringue in a saucepan with 2 tbsp water and heat until the syrup reaches 120C on a thermometer. While the sugar is coming up to temperature, use a mixer or electric whisk, to whisk the egg whites on the lowest setting. Once the sugar has reached 120C, carefully pour onto the egg whites and turn the mixer or electric whisk up, continuing to whisk until the whites are cool.\nNext, in a clean bowl, whisk the cream until it has soft peaks. Add the pur\u00e9e and chopped pistachios, then fold in the yolks. Once combined, fold in half the whites. Add the raspberries with the remaining whites, gently fold together, then pour into the lined loaf tin. Put in the freezer overnight.\nThe next day, remove the parfait from the tin. Cover it completely in the blitzed pistachios, then place on a tray, cover in cling film and return it to the freezer. When you\u2019re ready to serve, slice the parfait and serve with a few fresh raspberries.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/raspberry-pistachip-parfait-4fa2ed5.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "394 calories", "fatContent": "28 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "23 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "8 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.1 milligram of sodium"}}
