Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add the egg whites and 400ml water, and stir together with a wooden spoon to form a firm dough \u2013 add a little more water if needed. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 mins or until smooth. Wrap in cling film and set aside to rest for 1 hr. (You can also make the dough in a freestanding mixer with a dough hook attachment).\nHeat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3 and line a baking tray with parchment. Divide the dough into 4 even-sized pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll each into a circle almost 1cm thick. Place a lamb shank in the centre of each disc of dough and tuck 2 garlic cloves underneath. Brush the edge of the dough with a little water, then gather it up and around the lamb shank, leaving the bone exposed. Make sure all the meat is covered and the pastry is well sealed. Transfer to the lined tray. Can be assembled 1 day ahead and chilled. Put the lamb in the oven and bake for 3 hrs 30 mins, by which time the crust will have turned a dark brown.\nOnce the lamb is cooked, leave it to rest for 30 mins. Using a bread knife, open the crust and very carefully remove the shanks and the softened garlic cloves, then discard the crust. Place the shanks on a baking tray and drizzle with a little oil. Blowtorch the lamb (see tip) to give it a crisp, toasty finish. Serve the lamb with the garlic cloves, Soused red cabbage and Beer-braised Puy lentils (see Goes well with for the recipes).", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/salt-baked-lamb-shanks-9cad2c1.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "447 calories", "fatContent": "19 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "1 grams carbohydrates", "proteinContent": "67 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1 milligram of sodium"}}
