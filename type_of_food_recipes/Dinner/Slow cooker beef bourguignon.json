Add the herbs and flour and cook for another 2 mins. Pour a splash of the wine into a bowl, then add the stock cube, sugar and tomato pur\u00e9e and mix to form a paste. Scrape the paste into the onion mix and pour in the remaining wine. Bring the mixture to a bubble, then transfer to the slow cooker. Stir in the browned beef, topping up with a splash of water to cover the meat if needed. Simmer on low for 6-8 hrs until the meat is falling apart but still holding its shape.\nAbout 35 mins before serving, heat the remaining oil in a pan. Fry the bacon, shallots and mushrooms for 5-8 mins until caramelised and the veg is starting to soften, then tip into the slow cooker. Simmer the stew gently on high for 30 mins. If you want a thicker gravy, use the reduce function or leave the stew uncovered. Serve with mashed potatoes or crusty bread, if you like.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/slow-cooker-beef-bourguignon-3aa62ab.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "497 calories", "fatContent": "20 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "7 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "47 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1 milligram of sodium"}}
