Add another 1 tbsp oil to the pan, if you need to, while you\u2019re cooking the batches. Once all the pork is seared, transfer to a plate and set aside.\nAdd another 1 tbsp oil to the pan with a little butter and fry half the leeks with a pinch of salt for 10 mins until tender. Add the garlic, fry for a minute, then stir in the flour.\nPour in the cider, a little at a time, stirring to pick up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan and to combine everything. Add the stock, bay leaves and seared pork, then simmer, half-covered with a lid for 1-1\u00bd hrs until the meat is just tender (it will later cook to the point of falling apart in the oven). Can be prepared a day ahead.\nHeat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Simmer uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the sauce, if you need to \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be too liquid or the potatoes will sink into the sauce. Stir in the parsley, chopped sage, remaining leeks, and the cream, then season well.\nPeel both types of potatoes and cut into slices 2mm thick, by hand or using a mandoline. Alternate layers of potato and sweet potato in circles over the pie, or randomly, if you prefer. Dot the cubed butter over the top and bake for 1-1\u00bd hrs until the potato is tender. Nestle in the whole sage leaves, brushed in a little oil, for the last 10 mins. Leave to rest for 10 mins before serving.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/slow-cooked-pork-cider-sage-hotpot-f3f88ab.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "644 calories", "fatContent": "35 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "13 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "80 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "35 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.6 milligram of sodium"}}
