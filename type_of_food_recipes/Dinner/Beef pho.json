In the same pan, toast the spices for 2-3 mins and once they begin to smell fragrant, add them to the beef stock as well. Bring the stock to the boil, then turn to a simmer and cook for 30mins before straining.\nMeanwhile, cut the fat from the steak and wrap in cling film, then put into the freezer for 15 mins \u2013 this will make your steak really easy to slice! Slice it thinly, then cover with cling film again and pop into the fridge.\nTaste the beef stock and use the palm sugar, fish sauce and soy to season. Cook the noodles according to package instructions and split between two bowls, topping each with the sliced beef. Bring the stock to the boil and then pour into the bowls (the heat will cook the beef). Top each with the spring onions, chilli slices and herbs.
