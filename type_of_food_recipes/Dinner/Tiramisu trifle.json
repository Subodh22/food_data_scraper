Put the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl and, when the custard is boiling, pour it over, whisking until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. Leave to cool for 5 mins until just warm, then whisk in the butter until well combined. Pour the cr\u00e9meux over the cake layer in the dish and level with the back of a spoon. Chill for 1 hr until set.\nMix the remaining coffee liqueur or madeira with the cooled coffee in a shallow bowl. Dip the sponge fingers in the mixture for 5 seconds on each side, arranging them in a single layer over the set cr\u00e9meux, then vertically against the side of the trifle dish. Keep chilled while you prepare the tiramisu filling.\nTip the egg yolks, caster sugar and marsala wine into a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, ensuring the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the water, and beat with an electric whisk for 10 mins until pale and light. Put in the fridge to cool.\nMeanwhile, in a separate bowl, beat the mascarpone and double cream together to soft peaks using an electric whisk. Gently whisk in the cooled egg yolk mixture until the filling is smooth and lump-free. Spoon the tiramisu filling over the sponge fingers in the trifle dish and chill for at least 30 mins.\nMeanwhile, for the brown sugar cream, tip the double cream and brown sugar into a large bowl and beat with an electric whisk until the mixture holds soft peaks and can easily ripple off the spoon. Spoon dollops of the brown sugar cream over the tiramisu filling, then sift over the cocoa powder before serving. Will keep covered in the fridge for up to three days.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/11/Tiramisu-trifle-4585cd1.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "554 calories", "fatContent": "40 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "24 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "30 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "6 grams protein"}}
