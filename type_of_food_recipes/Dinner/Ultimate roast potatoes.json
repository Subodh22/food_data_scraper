As soon as the water reaches a full rolling boil, lower the heat, put your timer on and simmer the potatoes uncovered, reasonably vigorously, for 2 mins.\nMeanwhile, put 100g duck or goose fat or 100ml olive oil into the hot roasting tin and heat it in the oven for a few mins, so it\u2019s really hot.\nDrain the potatoes in a colander then shake the colander back and forth a few times to fluff up the outsides.\nSprinkle with 2 tsp flour and give another shake or two so they are evenly and thinly coated.\nCarefully put the potatoes into the hot fat \u2013 they will sizzle as they go in \u2013 then turn and roll them around so they are coated all over.\nSpread them in a single layer making sure they have plenty of room.\nRoast the potatoes for 15 mins, then take them out of the oven and turn them over.\nRoast for another 15 mins and turn them over again. Put them back in the oven for another 10-20 mins, or however long it takes to get them really golden and crisp. The colouring will be uneven, which is what you want.\nScatter with Maldon salt and serve straight away.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/roast-potatoes-main-7b0e23a.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "391 calories", "fatContent": "23 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams carbohydrates", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "5 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.42 milligram of sodium"}}
