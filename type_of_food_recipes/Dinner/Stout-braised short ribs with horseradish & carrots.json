Stir in the herbs and flour, and cook for a few minutes, then stir in the sugar, stout and stock, and bring to a simmer. Add the horseradish cream and some seasoning, then nestle the ribs into the sauce. Cover the pan and cook in the oven for 1 hr.\nPeel the carrots, keeping them whole. Remove the stew from the oven, stir gently and add the carrots. Cover and return to the oven for 2 hrs more until the ribs are tender. You can now serve the stew in a rustic style, as is. Alternatively, gently remove the ribs and carrots to a board. Strain the sauce through a sieve into a saucepan and bring to the boil, skimming off any froth that rises to the surface. Simmer for 5 mins until reduced by a third. Tip the reduced sauce back into the casserole dish, add back the ribs and carrots, and simmer for a few minutes to reheat the meat.
