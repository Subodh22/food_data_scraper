Pulse in short bursts, being careful not to overheat the motor, and scrape the sides with a spatula between pulses to incorporate any dry flour. Stop pulsing when the mixture has come together in even crumbs. Tip onto a work surface and knead for 5-10 mins until you have a smooth, firm dough. If it\u2019s very dry, you may need to add a splash of water to bring it together. Shape into a ball, wrap and chill for at least 1 hr and up to two days.\nKeeping the rest of the dough well covered, roll a quarter into a rectangle that will fit through the widest setting on your pasta machine. Pass the dough through the machine, reducing the width down to level three. This means it won\u2019t be super thin, but will have a nice bite to it when cooked.\nUnfold the dough onto a work surface dusted with semolina. Cut it into smaller 25cm sheets, then cut each of the sheets lengthways into 2.5cm-thick pappardelle strips. Toss the strips in semolina. Repeat the rolling and cutting with the remaining dough, a quarter at a time. Once all cut, leave to dry for a few mins on a parchment-lined tray generously dusted with semolina \u2013 this will make it easier to handle. Cook the pasta in a large pan of salted water for 3 mins, then drain to serve.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/hand-cut-pappardelle-d42271a.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "478 calories", "fatContent": "11 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "73 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "1 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "20 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.3 milligram of sodium"}}
