Drain and squeeze out the mushrooms (save and freeze the liquid to make a base for a gravy) and roughly chop.\nHeat the oil in a frying pan and gently cook the shallots and garlic for 3 mins. Turn up the heat, throw in the mushrooms and cook for a few mins more. Add the spinach, turn the heat up to high and cook until wilted and all the liquid has evaporated. Tip into a bowl and leave to cool. Beat in the cheeses and season with loads of pepper and a little salt. Set aside.\nTake the chicken breasts and remove the small fillet from the back. Cut a slit into the side of each chicken breast then stuff each one with a quarter of the spinach mixture, closing it with the cut-off fillet. Carefully wrap each stuffed chicken breast in a slice of prosciutto and chill until needed. Can be prepared up to a day ahead.\nTo cook, heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line up the chicken on a baking tray and roast for 20-25 mins until the prosciutto is frazzled at the edges, the cheese is oozing out and the chicken is cooked through.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/cheese-spinach-mushroom-stuffed-chicken-2a26624.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "397 calories", "fatContent": "19 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "1 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "48 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1 milligram of sodium"}}
