Tip these into the food processor with the garlic, herbs and 1\u00bd tsp sea salt. Blitz until smooth and pliable (check this by squeezing a clump in your hand; when ready, it should stay together). Tip the mix into a bowl, stir in the baking powder, cover and chill for 30 mins.\nForm into 12 small discs, then coat each lightly in the sesame seeds, if using. Chill for 15 mins more. The falafel can now be frozen for up to three months (see below).\nHeat a 1cm depth of oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat until small bubbles form on the surface. Fry the falafel in batches for 6 mins until deeply golden, turning over halfway through using a spatula or slotted spoon. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper. Leave to drain. Once cooled, the falafel can be frozen for up to three months (see below). Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 8. Put the falafel on a lightly oiled baking sheet and brush with some oil. Bake for 15-20 mins until crisp. Serve in the flatbreads with the fillings of your choice.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/01/Herby-falafel-8f7577d.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "333 calories", "fatContent": "15 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "2 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "11 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "15 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "2.1 milligram of sodium"}}
