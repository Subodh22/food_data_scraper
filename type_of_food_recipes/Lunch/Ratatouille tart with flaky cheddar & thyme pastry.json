To make the pastry, put the flour in a large bowl and mix in half the polenta, the cheese, thyme (reserving a few leaves to serve) and a good pinch of salt. Using a coarse cheese grater, grate in the frozen butter \u2013 try to handle it as little as possible so it doesn\u2019t get soft \u2013 and stir it in with a knife as you go. Give the mixture one last stir to make sure all the butter is coated with flour, then quickly stir in 125ml very cold water. Gently bring together with your hands (splashing in a little more water if it looks dry), then wrap in baking parchment and chill for 30 mins.\nSlice the tomatoes to roughly the thickness of a \u00a31 coin (use a mandoline, if you have one). Reserve about half of the tomato slices for the top of the tart, then roughly chop the rest into chunks.\nHeat the grill to high (or you can use the flame of a gas hob). Pierce the aubergine four or five times with the tip of a knife and grill (or hold over the gas flame using tongs), turning often, for 8-10 mins, or until the skin is charred and the aubergine is soft and collapsing. Leave to cool a little.\nHeat half the oil in a pan over a low-medium heat, and cook the onions with a pinch of salt for 10 mins until the onions start to caramelise. Meanwhile, scrape the skin off the aubergine (don\u2019t worry if some pieces cling to the flesh \u2013 it will add a smoky flavour). Roughly chop the aubergine flesh.\nAdd the garlic and aubergine to the onions and cook for another 5 mins, or until any liquid released from the aubergine has evaporated. Add the chopped tomatoes and sugar, season, and continue to cook for 5-10 mins until thickened. Leave to cool, then chill until ready to use. Can be prepared up to a day ahead.\nSlice the courgettes to roughly the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Put in a bowl and toss with a good pinch of salt. Leave for 10 mins.\nRemove the pastry from the fridge. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 with a baking tray inside (or a 30cm shallow skillet pan, if you have one). Roll the pastry out on a large sheet of baking parchment dusted with a little flour, to a circle about 35cm wide. Trim the edge if you want a neat finish.\nDrain any liquid from the courgettes, then tip onto a plate lined with kitchen paper. Pat dry to remove as much moisture as you can. Sprinkle the remaining polenta over the pastry, then top with the chilled tomato and aubergine mix. Spread it out using the back of a spoon, leaving a 3cm border around the edge.\nArrange the reserved tomato slices and the courgettes in overlapping concentric circles on top of the tart. Brush the vegetables with the remaining oil, season and sprinkle with the parmesan. Fold the pastry edge over the veg slightly, pressing gently to seal. Brush the pastry edge with the beaten yolk.\nCarefully slide the tart, still on the baking parchment, onto the hot tray or into the skillet pan. Bake for 45 mins until golden, then scatter with the extra thyme leaves, if using. Leave to cool a little and serve just warm, or at room temperature.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/Ratatouille-tart-f84f3a5.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "346 calories", "fatContent": "18 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "7 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "8 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.4 milligram of sodium"}}
