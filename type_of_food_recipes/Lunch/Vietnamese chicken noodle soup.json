Cover with a lid and bring to a very gentle simmer for about 15 mins.\nMeanwhile, cook the noodles, following pack instructions, until just cooked through (do not over-cook).

Return soup to the pot and bring to a boil. Season to taste with more fish sauce if needed.\nTo serve, ladle piping hot soup into bowls of noodles and chicken, and top with spring onion, carrot, bean sprouts, and herbs, plus the chilli, crispy shallots and kaffir lime leaf if using. Serve with a lime wedge to squeeze over, and more fish sauce and chilli to taste.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/chicken-pho-5fb5771.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "442 calories", "fatContent": "4 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "1 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "4 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "5 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "31 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.5 milligram of sodium"}}
