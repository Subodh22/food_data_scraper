Tip the squash and unpeeled garlic into a roasting tin, drizzle with 1 tbsp oil, season and toss to coat. Roast for 30 mins, stirring halfway through, until soft. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.\nMeanwhile, cook the onion in a frying pan over a medium heat with the remaining 1 tbsp oil for 8-10 mins until tender and slightly golden. Leave to cool.\nTip the flour, turmeric and a pinch of salt into a food processor. Add the butter and whizz until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Add the egg yolks and 2 tsp cold water, and blitz again until the mixture starts to clump together. Squeeze it between your fingers \u2013 if it sticks together, tip the mixture onto a work surface. If it\u2019s too dry, add more water, 1 tsp at a time. Knead the pastry a few times just to bring it together, but don\u2019t overwork it. Shape into two circles, one slightly smaller than the other, then wrap in baking parchment and chill in the fridge for at least 20 mins.\nSqueeze the garlic from its skins into the roasted squash and mash together. Add the fried onion, grate over some nutmeg, tip in the chilli flakes, if using, and feta, and mix.\nButter six holes of a muffin tin and line each with a strip of baking parchment that overhangs the top. Roll the larger circle of pastry out on a lightly floured surface to the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Use a 10cm cutter to stamp out six circles (you may need to re-roll the pastry to get all six). Press the pastry circles into the prepared muffin tin, patching any cracks with the pastry offcuts. Spoon in the squash filling.\nRoll the remaining pastry circle out as you did the large one, but use an 8cm cutter to cut out six lids. Cut spooky pumpkin faces into the lids using a small, sharp knife. Press the lids over the pies in the tin and brush with the beaten egg. Bake for 40 mins until golden brown, then leave to cool for 10 mins in the tin before lifting out. Eat hot or leave to cool completely. Will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two days or the freezer for up to two months. Reheat in a low oven for 10 mins, if you like.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/09/Mini-pumpkin-and-feta-pies-68d403d.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "493 calories", "fatContent": "31 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "5 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "12 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.3 milligram of sodium"}}
