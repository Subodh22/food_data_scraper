Add the bicarb and poach the pork on a gentle simmer for 5 mins.\nMeanwhile, put the coriander seeds and chilli flakes in a small frying pan and toast over a medium heat until the seeds are aromatic, being careful not to burn the chilli.\nCarefully lift the pork out of the pan using two slotted spoons and put in a roasting tin, skin-side down. Pat dry with kitchen towel and pierce the meat all over with a knife. Grind the toasted spices with the salt using a pestle and mortar, then cover the meat with half the spiced salt. Turn the pork over and pat the skin dry with kitchen paper, pressing down to make sure it\u2019s dry . Squeeze the lemon juice all over the skin, then rub the lemon, flesh-side down, over it. Pat dry again and rub the remaining salt mixture over, making sure it gets into the grooves. Chill, uncovered, for 1 hr, or as long as possible (up to 24 hours).\nBring the pork out of the fridge 30 mins before you want to cook it and heat oven to 240C/220C fan/ gas 9. Nestle the fennel and onion underneath the meat. Roast for 40 mins, turning the roasting tin halfway so that it cooks evenly. Turn the oven down to 160C/140C fan/ gas 3, add the apple, apple juice and sherry to the tin and cook for 1 hr. Turn the oven up to 220C/200C fan/ gas 7 and roast for a further 10-15 mins until the crackling is crisp. Remove from the oven and rest for at least 15 mins, keeping the juices and apple, onion and fennel warm in a low oven. Flip the pork over and use a very sharp knife to cut it up into chunks, in line with the rib bones. Spoon over the juices. Use any leftovers in Rosie's pork & black bean tacos or spicy Singapore noodles.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/crispy-roast-pork-belly--078af9a.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "531 calories", "fatContent": "32 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "11 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "38 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "3.2 milligram of sodium"}}
