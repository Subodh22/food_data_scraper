Add the wine, if using, and bubble for a few minutes, then add the stock and stir well. Slice the chicken and return it to the pan \u2013 don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s not fully cooked through at this point, it will finish cooking in the oven.\nStir in the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, peas, 1 tbsp mustard and the tarragon, and bubble for a few minutes until thick and saucy. Add a splash more stock or water if it seems too thick Remove the pie filling from the heat. Whisk the remaining \u00bd tbsp mustard with the egg in a bowl.\nHeat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Spoon the filling into a pie dish with a lip and use some of the egg mix to brush the sides of the dish. Unroll the pastry over the top of the pie and crimp the edges against the sides of the dish, then cut away any excess with a knife. Will keep frozen, well covered, for up to three months.\nBrush the remaining egg glaze over the pie and make a small steam hole in the middle. Bake for 40 mins until golden and puffed. Serve with buttered new potatoes and steamed greens or carrots, if you like.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/spring-chicken-pot-pie-9bd9a0e.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "577 calories", "fatContent": "38 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "5 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "5 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "23 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.6 milligram of sodium"}}
