When the dough is ready, tip it onto a lightly floured surface and divide into six equal pieces. Roll into balls and leave to rest on a floured tray, covered with a damp teatowel, in the fridge for at least 4 hrs, and up to 18 hrs \u2013 the longer you leave the dough, the more sour it will taste.\nMeanwhile, make the tomato sauce. Drain some of the juice from the plummed tomatoes and tip the rest into a bowl with the olive oil, oregano and a generous pinch of salt. Combine by either scrunching everything together with your fingers (this will make a chunky sauce) or blitz with a stick blender (this will make a smooth sauce). Chill until needed.\nTo make the pizzas, heat a grill to high and prepare an ovenproof frying pan. On a floured surface, push and stretch a ball of dough into a circle roughly the same size as the pan. Get the pan very hot, then working quickly and carefully, drape it into the pan, spread over some of the sauce, a handful of mozzarella and some basil, if using.\nCook for 2 mins, until little bubbles appear, then put the pan under the grill for another 2-4 mins until the sides are puffed up and the cheese has melted. Remove, drizzle with a little olive oil and cut into wedges. Repeat with the remaining dough.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/sourdough-pizza-with-cutter_1-46ee50a.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "502 calories", "fatContent": "15 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "69 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "5 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "21 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "2.3 milligram of sodium"}}
