Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper using a slotted spoon, and set aside to cool. Set the pan with the fat aside, and leave to cool. For the pastry, put the flour, 1/2 tsp salt, the paprika, cayenne pepper, cooled chorizo fat and the butter in the bowl of a large food processor and blitz until the mixture looks like coarse breadcrumbs. Gradually pulse in 4 tbsp cold water until it comes together into a dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead gently until smooth. Wrap the dough and chill for at least 10 mins. Will keep chilled for up to three days.\nHeat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Roll the chilled pastry out on a floured work surface to the thickness of a 50p coin then lift it into a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin, leaving an overhang. Prick the base all over with a fork, line with baking parchment, then fill with baking beans. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake for 15 mins. Remove the parchment and beans, then bake for 15-20 mins more until golden and crisp. Trim away the pastry that is overhanging using a serrated knife.\nMeanwhile, whisk the eggs, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and cream together, season, then stir in the cheese and cooled chorizo. Pour into the pastry case and bake for 25-30 mins until the filling is just set. Leave to cool in the tin, then remove from the tin and slice. Will keep in the fridge for up to three days.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/manchego-and-chorizo-quiche-b0b7689.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "460 calories", "fatContent": "35 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "1 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "14 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.3 milligram of sodium"}}
