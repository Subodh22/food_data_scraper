Squeeze out the excess water. Put half the wilted spinach in a blender with 150ml hot water and blitz to a smooth green pur\u00e9e.\nDissolve the yeast in 2 tbsp tepid water. Put the flour in a large bowl with the spinach pur\u00e9e, 2 tsp salt and the yeast mixture. Bring together into a dough, adding up to 50ml more water if it\u2019s too dry. Knead for 5 mins, then leave in a covered bowl at room temperature for 1 hr until doubled in size. After an hour, divide the dough into four pieces, then cover again and leave to prove for another hour.\nFor the pesto, put the remaining 200g spinach, half the basil, the pine nuts, parmesan, oil, lemon juice and garlic in a food processor and blitz until smooth. Season to taste and loosen with up to 3 tbsp water, if needed. Mix the lemon zest with the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and some seasoning and 2-3 tbsp water to loosen. Set aside along with the pesto.\nHeat the oven to 240C/220C fan/ gas 9 with a large baking sheet inside. Flatten the proved dough balls into rounds on a floured work surface, then roll each one out until about 25cm wide and 5mm thick. Put each pizza base on its own sheet of baking parchment.\nSpoon the lemony cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche over the pizza bases and spread almost to the edges, leaving a small border. Drizzle over half the pesto, then top with the broccoli. Dot over the tomatoes and mozzarella, then sprinkle with the chilli flakes.\nCook one pizza at a time by sliding the pizza on its baking parchment onto the hot baking sheet in the oven and baking for 12-15 mins until the crust is golden and crisp. Repeat with the remaining pizzas, then drizzle over the remaining pesto. Scatter over the leaves from the remaining basil, then drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with extra chilli flakes, if you like.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/04/Super-green-pizza-ef9644e.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "783 calories", "fatContent": "44 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "4 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "6 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "25 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "2.1 milligram of sodium"}}
