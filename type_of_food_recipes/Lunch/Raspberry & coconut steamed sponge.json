Fold in the remaining flour, the coconut and a pinch of salt, then the vanilla and coconut cream. Spoon the mix into the prepared basins, leaving a 1cm gap at the top.\nPut the basins on a baking tray, transfer to the freezer and freeze until solid. Will keep in an airtight container, or tightly wrapped in the freezer for up to three months.\nHeat the oven to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4. Put the basins in a deep baking dish and half-fill with boiled water from the kettle. Tightly cover the dish with foil and bake for 1 hr, or until a skewer inserted into the middle of a sponge comes out clean.\nWarm the custard with the remaining 2 tbsp coconut cream, if using, and pour into shallow bowls. Run a knife around the sides of the basins and carefully turn out the sponges onto the custard.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/raspberry-coconut-steamed-sponge-2f8a8c4.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "665 calories", "fatContent": "37 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "24 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "72 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "51 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "2 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "10 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.5 milligram of sodium"}}
