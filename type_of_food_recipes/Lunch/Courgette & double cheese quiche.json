Blitz to a rough crumb, then add the yolks and 2 tbsp water. Pulse to a loose dough, then tip the mix out onto a floured surface and knead a few times to a smooth pastry.\nRoll the pastry between two sheets of baking parchment to the thickness of a \u00a31 coin \u2013 the disc should be big enough to fit a 20cm tart tin with a loose base. Chill in the fridge for 1 hr.\nWhile the pastry is chilling, salt the courgette and spring onions, and leave for 1 hr in a colander with a bowl underneath to catch the juices.\nUse the pastry to line the tin. Work it into the corners, then cut away any pastry from the edges. Pop back in the fridge for 10 mins or so.\nHeat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line the pastry case with parchment and baking beans, and bake for 20 mins. Lift off the parchment and beans, and continue to bake until the base is fully cooked and biscuity brown. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.\nTip the courgette and spring onions into a clean tea towel and squeeze out the remaining excess water. Tip into a large mixing bowl and stir through the blue cheese, onion marmalade and thyme. Spread the mix over the bottom of the tart case.\nWhisk together the cream, whole egg and yolks with some seasoning. Pour this over the courgette filling and bake for 30-35 mins until just set. Remove from the oven and leave to cool completely before cutting into slices.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/courgette-double-cheese-quiche-e59413f.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "330 calories", "fatContent": "24 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "2 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "1 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "10 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.5 milligram of sodium"}}
