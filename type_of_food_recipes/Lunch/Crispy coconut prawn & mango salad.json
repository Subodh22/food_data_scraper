Combine the desiccated coconut with the cornflour and some seasoning. Drain the prawns and turn in the cornflour mixture to coat, shaking off any excess.\nDrop one prawn into the oil; if it sizzles, add a few more, but don\u2019t overcrowd the pan. Fry for 1-2 mins on each side until crisp and golden, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper.
