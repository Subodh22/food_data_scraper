Pour a kettleful of boiling water over the shallots, then set aside for 2 mins until cool enough to handle \u2013 this will make them easier to peel. Cut off the root and remove the papery skins. Heat the remaining oil in a large casserole or frying pan large enough to fit the pork. Brown the shallots for a few mins then tip into the slow cooker. Add the celeriac and apples, season well and give them a mix.\nBrown the pork in the same pan, on all sides, not forgetting the ends. Sit on top of the veg and apples, fat-side up, nestling the joint in a little so you can fit the lid on. Pour the wine into the frying pan and bubble for a minute, scraping the bottom of the pan to pick up any tasty bits. Pour in the stock, honey and mustard, bubble for another min, then pour over the pork. Cover with a lid and cook on low for 5-6 hrs (depending on slow cooker size), turning the pork and stirring the veg halfway through cooking.\nRemove the pork, wrap in foil and leave to rest for 10 mins before carving to serve alongside the veg with roast potatoes and greens.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/pork-772b6b2.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "597 calories", "fatContent": "41 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "9 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "42 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.7 milligram of sodium"}}
