Spoon the mixture into a container.\nIf you like your tacos crispy, heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4, brush them with a little oil, place on a baking sheet and cook for 10-15 mins. To build each taco, spoon on some avocado pur\u00e9e and spread out to the edge. Spoon on the spiced tuna and sprinkle over the chillies, pomegranate seeds, coriander and spring onions, drizzle with more oil and add a lime wedge to the plate. Eat with your hands, if soft, or a knife and fork if crispy.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/spice-cured-tuna-tacos-c4746f8.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "347 calories", "fatContent": "18 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "4 grams sugar", "proteinContent": "18 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.1 milligram of sodium"}}
