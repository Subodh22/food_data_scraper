After 7 mins, immediately scoop out the eggs using a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl of iced water, cracking the shells a little with the spoon as you do (this makes them easier to peel later). Leave to cool completely, then peel and set aside.\nSqueeze the sausagemeat from the skins into a small bowl, add the bacon and mix to combine. For the coating, tip the beaten egg into a shallow container. Combine the flour and mustard powder in a second, and stir together the crushed crisps and panko breadcrumbs in a third.\nDivide the sausage mixture into six rough portions. Lay a sheet of baking parchment on the work surface, then drop a portion of the meat into the middle of the parchment. Top with a second sheet of baking parchment and flatten the meat into a disc using your palm. Remove the top sheet of parchment. Roll one of the eggs in the flour mix, then place in the middle of the sausagemeat disc. Use the parchment to help you wrap the meat around the egg so it\u2019s completely encased, trimming any excess from the top and bottom. Repeat with the rest of the eggs and meat. Dip the sausage-coated eggs back in the flour mix, then the egg, then the crumbs, back into the egg, then finally, in the crumbs again. Can be prepared up to a few hours ahead and chilled until ready to fry.\nHeat a 5cm depth of oil in a wok, wide saucepan or deep-fat fryer until it reaches 160C or until a cube of bread dropped in turns golden in 10 seconds. Lower in as many eggs as you can, being careful not to overcrowd the pan, and fry for 6-8 mins, gently turning until golden and crisp on all sides. Drain on kitchen paper, leave to cool a little, then serve.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/07/Scotch-eggs-e0f19d3.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "520 calories", "fatContent": "32 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "2 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "23 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.6 milligram of sodium"}}
