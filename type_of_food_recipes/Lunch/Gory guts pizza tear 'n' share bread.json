Add the yeast to one side of the bowl and 2 tsp salt to the other. Pour in 300ml warm water and mix with a wooden spoon or in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook until you have a soft dough (you may need to add up to 25ml more water if the dough seems dry). Knead on a lightly floured work surface for 10 mins or in the mixer for 5 mins until you have a soft, stretchy dough. Rub a little of the oil over the ball of dough, then put it in a clean bowl and cover with a tea towel. Leave to prove in a warm place for 2 hrs, or chill overnight (or for up to 24 hrs).\nHeat the remaining oil in a pan over a medium heat and sizzle the garlic for 30 seconds \u2013 don\u2019t let it brown. Add the tomatoes, oregano and 2 tsp sugar. Season well. Reduce the heat to low-medium and bubble for 20-30 mins until the sauce is thick and rich. Use a potato masher to squash any remaining lumps of tomato into the sauce. Leave to cool until ready to use. Once completely cool, will keep in the fridge in an airtight container for up to three days or the freezer for six months.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to assemble, spread the sauce over the base of a large roasting tin or baking dish (ours was 40 x 30cm). Roll the dough out on a floured surface into a 60 x 30cm rectangle. Cut the rectangle in half lengthways so you have two smaller rectangles measuring 15 x 60cm. Pile the cheese along the centre of each rectangle and add any pizza toppings you like. Pinch the long sides of the rectangles together to enclose the fillings \u2013 do this carefully so you don\u2019t break the dough. Squeeze along the length of each long sausage to make sure they are well-sealed, and gently stretch them out to make them slightly longer. Arrange the dough sausages over the sauce seam-side down, wiggling them into the shape of intestines but leaving a little space between for the bread to expand as it bakes. Cover and leave to prove at room temp for 30 mins or chill for up to 8 hrs. Heat the oven to 200C/180C/gas 6.\nBake for 45 mins until the bread is golden brown. Brush with the herby garlic butter, then leave to cool for at least 10 mins before serving.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/09/Gory-guts-pizza-tear-n-share-bread-b4dbb69.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "327 calories", "fatContent": "11 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "4 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "14 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.6 milligram of sodium"}}
