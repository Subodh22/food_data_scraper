You need chunks or whole potatoes roughly the size of a clementine, so peel and leave whole, halve or quarter accordingly. Place the potatoes in a large pan of cold, salted water \u2013 salting is important, so don\u2019t skip it. Bring the water to the boil and simmer gently for about 15 mins until the potatoes are cooked all the way through but not on the brink of collapse. Gently drain the potatoes in a colander, but do not shake them or ruffle them up \u2013 just leave them to drain and cool. Once there is no more steam coming off them, place on a tray in a single layer and put them in the fridge, uncovered, until ready to roast.\nHeat oven to 200C/180C/gas 6 (or put them in when you turn it up for the turkey). Pour oil into a deep roasting tin to give an even layer of about 0.5cm. Place the tin in the oven for 5 mins to heat the oil, then remove from the oven. One at a time and working methodically (starting at one corner of the roasting tin and lining them up as you go) place each potato in the oil and use a spoon to turn it so it\u2019s completely coated. Don\u2019t worry about the oil cooling down too much. Once all the potatoes are in the tin in a single layer, not touching, place the tin in the oven and cook for 40 mins, undisturbed.\nRemove from the oven and \u2013 again, meticulously \u2013 turn each potato. Return to the oven for 20 mins, then repeat the potato-turning process again. If, at this stage, your other side dishes allow you to, turn the oven up to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and give the potatoes a final 20 mins. By now you should have potatoes that are everything a roastie should be: deep, golden and crunchy on the outside with an extra-fluffy middle \u2013 just sprinkle with a little sea salt to serve.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/best-ever-roast-potatoes-ebb7897.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "434 calories", "fatContent": "17 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "61 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "2 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "6 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "7 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.6 milligram of sodium"}}
