Scatter over the cheese, fold the pastry in half and roll out again into a circle that fits a 25cm tart tin with an overhang. Chill for 20 mins. Meanwhile, cook the asparagus in boiling water for 3 mins, then drain and refresh under cold water. Cook the fresh peas the same way for a minute, or simply defrost the frozen peas.\nHeat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Prick the base of the tart well with a fork, line with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake the tart for 30 mins, remove the parchment and beans, prick again if it has puffed up, then bake for another 10-15 mins until biscuit brown.\nMeanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, add the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and cream, season and add a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg. Scatter the peas and most of the watercress over the tart and crumble over half the goat\u2019s cheese. Pour over the creamy egg mixture, then lay the asparagus spears on top. Finally, slice the remaining goat\u2019s cheese and arrange on top, then bake for 25-30 mins until the custard is just set and the cheese is golden brown. Leave to cool in the tin, trim the edges of the pastry, then remove from the tin, scatter with the remaining watercress and serve cut into slices. Can be made up to a day ahead, leave out the fridge to keep the pastry crisp.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/double-cheese-spring-vegetable-tart-fe6bec7.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "755 calories", "fatContent": "63 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "35 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "3 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "18 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.1 milligram of sodium"}}
