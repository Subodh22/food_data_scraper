Make a well in the centre and pour in the ghee and 100ml lukewarm water. Combine, then add up to 50ml more lukewarm water to bring the mix together as a dough. Knead for 5 mins, then put in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave for 1 hr.\nFor the baked eggs, heat the oil in a large frying pan or heatproof shallow casserole dish. Fry the onion with a pinch of salt over a medium heat for 15 mins or until golden. Lower the heat, add the ginger, garlic, most of the chillies and all the dried spices, and cook for 2 mins. Stir in the tomatoes and cook for a further 2 mins.\nPour in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer, season to taste, then stir through the spinach. Once wilted, simmer, uncovered, for 5 mins. Remove from the heat.\nDivide the dough into four balls, and roll out into 18cm discs about 3mm thick, covering them with a damp tea towel as you work. Heat a pan over a medium heat. Melt a little ghee in the pan and cook the parathas one at a time for 1-2 mins on each side. Keep them warm in a low oven as you work.\nHeat the grill to medium. Make eight dips in the spinach mixture and crack an egg into each. Cover with a lid or tightly with foil, cook over a medium-low heat for 5 mins, then grill for a further 3-5 mins or until the white is set but the yolks runny. Finish with the reserved red chillies and coriander. Serve with the paratha on the side.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2021/02/Spinach_coconut_turmeric_eggs-900ee31.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "634 calories", "fatContent": "40 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "23 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "8 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "5 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "23 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.8 milligram of sodium"}}
