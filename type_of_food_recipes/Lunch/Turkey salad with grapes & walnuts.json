Top with half the potatoes, and slice and pile on half the turkey. Toss the avocado with a good squeeze of lime, then scatter half on top with half the grapes and half the walnuts. Spoon over half of the remaining dressing.\nIf packing this into lunchboxes, do the same with the remaining ingredients in the lunchboxes, but in reverse, so the green salad is at the top. Keep the dressing in a pot separately, to drizzle over just before eating.
