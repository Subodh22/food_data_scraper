Remove from the heat. Cool slightly. Combine with 1 egg and the flour, season and form into eight patties.\nFor the herb yogurt, tip everything into a food processor with a pinch of sea salt, and blitz until smooth.\nHeat the butter and remaining oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, and fry the rosti for 4-5 mins on each side until crisp and cooked through. Put on a baking tray and keep warm in a low oven.\nBring a pan of lightly salted water to a simmer with the vinegar. Stir to create a whirlpool. Crack 1 egg into a cup, wait until the whirlpool has almost subsided, then tip in the egg. Poach for 2-3 mins, remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Repeat with the other eggs.\nServe the rosti with the herb yogurt, poached eggs, smoked salmon and some extra dill.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/12/Beetroot-rosti-with-green-yogurt-and-salmon-93ad63e.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "593 calories", "fatContent": "28 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "16 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "8 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "31 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "2 milligram of sodium"}}
