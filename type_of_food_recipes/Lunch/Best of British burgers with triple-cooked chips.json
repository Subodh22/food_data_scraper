Drain well, return to the pan and shake with the lid on to fluff up the edges. Take care not to break up the chips too much.\nHeat the oil in your largest saucepan to about 150C, when a little piece of potato should just start to sizzle. Fry the chips for 5-8 mins until crisp but not brown. Dry thoroughly on kitchen paper and leave to cool.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the beef mince, shallots, mustard, egg yolk and breadcrumbs until well combined. Divide into 4 equal portions and shape into burgers. Cover and chill the burgers in the fridge for at least 30 mins (you can prep these up to 2 days ahead).\nHeat a griddle pan until hot and coat the burgers in oil. Cook for about 10-12 mins, turning regularly, until cooked through. Leave to rest on a plate under some foil. Cook the bacon in the pan until really crisp, then set aside with the burgers. Place the cut side of the buns onto the griddle to toast slightly.\nReheat the oil so that it\u2019s really hot \u2013 about 180C \u2013 and again cook the chips for 5 mins or so until golden. Drain and sprinkle over sea salt. Spread ketchup over the toasted buns and fill each with the burgers and other ingredients. Serve with the chips and some coleslaw, if you like.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/recipe-image-legacy-id-1284526_7-fadb8e0.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "665 calories", "fatContent": "36 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "2 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "4 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "33 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "0.9 milligram of sodium"}}
