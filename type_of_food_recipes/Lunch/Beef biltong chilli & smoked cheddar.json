Tip into a bowl and set aside. Scatter the onion in a dry saucepan and cook over a low heat for about 30 mins until very dark and soft, adding a little oil if needed to stop it burning. Meanwhile, heat the 2 tbsp oil in a wide pan and crumble in the mince. Cook on a low heat for 30 mins \u2013 it will release lots of liquid, which needs to evaporate, then eventually it will sizzle in its own fat. If the pan becomes too dry, drizzle in a little more oil. Towards the end of the cooking time, stir the mince until it becomes speckled with crisp brown bits. Mix in the cumin, coriander and chipotle paste, then stir in the stock, bring to a simmer and cook for 10 mins.\nTip the caramelised onions into the food processor (no need to wash it) and blitz until smooth. Add the onion pur\u00e9e to the chilli along with most of the biltong and the beans. Stir and simmer for 20 mins until rich and thick. Season with the lime juice and cayenne, and keep on a low heat for a few mins more.\nLadle the chilli into a bowl and sprinkle over the cheese, the remaining biltong, sliced jalape\u00f1os and a little puffed rice. Finish with the lime zest and coriander leaves. Serve with tortilla wraps or over brown rice.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/beef-biltong-chilli-smoked-cheddar-d79ccab.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "502 calories", "fatContent": "27 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "5 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "6 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "45 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1.9 milligram of sodium"}}
