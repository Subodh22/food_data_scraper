Pour \u00be of the marinade over the chicken and chorizo, reserving the rest to glaze the skewers later. Marinate for at least 2 hrs or overnight. Whisk the leftover 1 tbsp honey into the reserved marinade.\nTo make the flatbreads, mix the flour, olive oil, salt and yeast in a large bowl. Add 700ml water and knead to a rough dough. Tip onto a floured work surface and knead for 10 mins until smooth and elastic. Transfer to an oiled bowl and cover. Leave to double in size, about 1 hr.\nKnock the dough back and divide into 16 small balls about 140g each. Roll each out on a floured work surface until a few millimetres thick and about 20cm wide. Heat a dry frying pan on a medium high heat and cook the dough for 3-4 mins until golden underneath and large bubbles start forming. Flip and cook for 1-2 mins more until lightly golden. You can keep the flatbreads warm in a low oven or on the barbecue, wrapped in foil.\nThread the chicken, chorizo and peppers onto eight large or 16 small metal skewers. Season with salt. Light a barbecue, let the flames die down and the coals turn ashy white, or heat the grill to medium high. Grill the skewers for 8-10 mins, turning every few mins until the chicken is cooked through. Use the remaining marinade to glaze the meat when turning.\nWith a fork, slide the meat and peppers off the skewers on to the flatbreads. Serve sides separately for guests to assemble their own kebabs.", "act_image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/sticky-chicken-chorizo-skewers-2192e15.jpg", "act_nutrients": {"calories": "344 calories", "fatContent": "22 grams fat", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams saturated fat", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams carbohydrates", "sugarContent": "7 grams sugar", "fiberContent": "3 grams fiber", "proteinContent": "26 grams protein", "sodiumContent": "1 milligram of sodium"}}
